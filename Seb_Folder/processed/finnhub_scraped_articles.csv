The stock market has soared over the last decade. A $10,000 investment made in a market-tracking fund like theVanguard S&P 500 ETF(VOO-0.06%)at the start of 2014 would be worth $29,673 today after having grown at a compound annual rate of 11.6%, assuming that dividends were reinvested along the way. But the handful of elite stocks known asthe FAANG grouphas delivered even stronger returns. In the last decade, an equal-weighted and dividend-reinvested portfolio of these five stocks would have grown from $10,000 to $89,051. That's a mind-blowing 24.7% compound annual growth rate. It was a bumpy ride, as the FAANG portfolio outperformed theS&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC)tracker in five years and underperformed in the other five, but stellar results of 2015, 2020, and 2023 outweighed the weak 2022 period. In case you're not familiar with FAANG, I'm talking about these familiar companies: The mildest 10-year gain among these top-shelf stocks was 400% for Alphabet. At the other end of the scale, Apple led the way with an 867% share price increase. The Cupertino-based iPhone maker is also the only dividend payer of the bunch; reinvesting those payouts would have lifted an investor's total return on Apple stock to a cool 1,000% in 10 years. But even the members of this exclusive club aren't always indisputable buys. Right now, I see two excellent investment opportunities for 2024 in this bunch, but one that investors should avoid until further notice. The Google parent took a hard fall in 2022. Both of its dual-class stock types fell by as much as 42% as the company was hamstrung by a rickety global economy and a weak digital advertising market. Overall, Alphabet's stock has gone essentially nowhere over the past two years, posting a loss of 3%. That said, its formerly stalled growth is back in action now. Alphabet's trailing-12-month sales stand at $297 billion today, up from $258 billion in fiscal year 2021. That's 15% higher, in case you prefer to think in percentages. Free cash flow rose from $67 billion to $78 billion over the same period, a 16% increase. Above all, Alphabet's future looks bright. The advertising market is coming back from its inflation-induced slump. Google Cloud is a leading provider of cloud-based access to powerful artificial intelligence (AI) tools, and the company evendesigns its own AI accelerator microchips. So Alphabet's stock chart has stalled while the business rekindled its fading growth. These days, Alphabet shares can be had at the modest valuations of 27 times trailing earnings and 23 times free cash flows. These readings stand below their long-term averages, and you know Alphabet will stay relevant in the long run. Ergo, this looks like a great time toscoop up some Alphabet shares on the cheap. If Alphabet took a bruising in 2022, the market took Netflix behind the woodshed for a proper pummeling. The streaming video pioneer's stock dropped by as much as 72% last year, and despite a strong rebound, Netflix still trades 19% below where it ended 2021. After a brief period when its investment theme was horror story, the company looks more like a wholesome family-friendly feature again, and well worth binge-investing in. The thing is, the big drop it took in 2022 never made sense to me. Investors essentially punished Netflix for doing exactly what they had been hoping it would do -- putting a fresh focus on margins and profitable revenue growth. Management's enhanced desire for profitability came at the cost of slower customer growth, which used to be the most essential figure to watch in each of Netflix's quarterly reports. Old habits die hard, and the market's reaction to Netflix's updated strategy was brutal. Now, Netflix's stock price has approximately tripled from the multiyear low it touched in mid-2021. The most glaringly obvious opportunity to take advantage of the buying window is behind us. Still, Netflix strikes me as a solid buy with reignited growth engines and modest valuation ratios. In particular, Netflix stock is cheaper than ever on a price-to-free-cash-flow basis, which is the exact financial metric the company's critics used to complain about the most. Cash flows may dip somewhat in 2024 as Netflix's content production projects get back on track after thewriters' and actors' strikes of 2023, but the long-term trend is clear. Netflix is no longer seeking customers at any cost. Instead, the company is optimizing its cash flows and profits, even at the cost of slower subscriber growth. I'm perfectly fine with that switch, and Wall Street as a whole should eventually embrace it as well. Until then, Netflix remains a no-brainer buy in my book. I'm not here to throw Meta Platform under the bus, but the operator of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp just doesn't look like a buy right now. The company's all-in bet on the metaverse is years away from paying metaphorical dividends. The Reality Labs division's revenues amount to a rounding error in Meta's overall financial structure, clocking in at 0.6% of total sales in the recent third-quarter report. But management is leaning into that potential growth driver with all its might. Those $210 million in third-quarter revenues came at the cost of an operating loss of $3.7 billion for the Reality Labs division. But the company exceeded Wall Street's earnings expectations in three of this year's four earnings reports andinvestors see Mark Zuckerberg's business as a promising AI innovator. So the stock has gained 198% in 2023, largely erasing 2022's price drop. ""Wait a minute, Anders,"" I hear you say. ""Isn't this the same story as Alphabet, which experienced similar share price trends and advertising quirks over the last two years? If you like Alphabet, you should love Meta Platforms too."" Well, I see the similarities, but Meta's situation is dramatically different from Alphabet's. The company formerly known as Facebook may have some AI ideas in its holster, but it can't match Google's decades of AI expertise or the AI-infused heft of the Google Cloud service. And if AI is supposed to save Meta from its low-growth morass, the heavy spending on metaverse projects must be viewed as an expensive distraction. In sum, Meta Platforms seems likea momentum-powered stockright now, and I'm not convinced that AI will be a game-changer for the company. If and when the broader market reaches the same conclusion, Meta's stock could experience a painful price correction. Until then, I'd rather keep my hands off this overheated social media stock, even if it is part of the market-beating FAANG group.

       from The Motley Fool's Premium Investing Services. Become a Motley Fool member today toget instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources,and more.Learn More Only three of the seven make the cut as buys at current levels. The ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks dominated the market in 2023. The worst performer in the group,Apple(AAPL0.49%), rose 49%, and the best,Nvidia(NVDA2.98%), jumped nearly 240%. But with such strong runs behind them, do any of them have room left to grow in 2024? The answer: Yes, and some are still worth buying at their current prices. I'm breaking the seven up into buy, sell, and hold groups. Starting with the sell set, I think Apple and Nvidia's stock prices far outpaced their businesses. Nvidia's 2023 success has been spurred on by the artificial intelligence (AI) arms race, and its business has responded in kind. In its fiscal 2024 third quarter (which ended Oct. 29), revenue rose 206% year over year. Furthermore, management guided for $20 billion in fiscal Q4 revenue, up 231%. The stock's movement was warranted given the company's sales growth, but I'm concerned that investors are forgetting that Nvidia operates in a cyclical industry. Nvidia goes through boom and bust cycles, and right now is certainly a boom. However, it's unknown how many AI data centers will need to be built in the near to medium term. If demand for its high-powered chips is satisfied shortly, the stock may come crashing back down to earth. Plus, it's trading at 65 times earnings -- a quite expensive premium. From a business standpoint, Apple is the opposite of Nvidia. Its sales declined throughout 2023. Even so, its stock skyrocketed. This makes little sense, and more headwinds are coming up: a U.S. International Trade Commission order this month forced Apple to halt the import and sale of some Apple Watches due to a patent dispute (although a court ruling temporarily allowed sales to resume). With all this in mind, 2024 could be a tough year for the company. And considering that Apple stock has a higher valuation than ""Magnificent Seven"" membersAlphabet(GOOG0.34%)(GOOGL0.39%)andMeta Platforms(META0.03%), it doesn't make a lot of sense to own it compared to its peers. I viewMicrosoft(MSFT-0.58%)andTesla(TSLA1.09%)as holds currently. Microsoft had a strong year, as its revenues andearnings per share (EPS)steadily rose. However, Microsoft trades at a steep premium, even on a forward earnings basis. Microsoft is executing well, but its valuation is a bit too much from a historical perspective to consider buying. Still, it's far from a sell. Tesla is one of the hardest companies to value on Wall Street, as its valuation is wrapped up in expectations for future products. It's also set to face some added headwinds. Starting in 2024,some Tesla models will only qualify for half of the $7,500 federal EV tax creditdue to where the automaker sources materials for their batteries and where it produces them. When judging whether any given moment is a better time to buy or sell Tesla stock, I like to look at its price-to-earnings and price-to-sales ratio compared to historical trends. For Tesla, these are trading roughly near the midpoint of valuations seen since mid-2022. I'm taking a wait-and-see approach to Tesla stock heading into the new year as the stock doesn't look like a bargain at these prices. That leaves Alphabet, Meta Platforms, andAmazon(AMZN0.35%)in the buy now category. These stocks trade at reasonable levels and are expecting strong tailwinds next year. Even though Alphabet and Meta have AI investments, they are mostly advertising businesses. In 2022 and 2023, the advertising market was fairly weak as companies pulled back on their marketing spending due to fears that a recession was coming. However, now that we have lapped that pullback, Alphabet and Meta are posting meaningful growth in their advertising businesses. Their ad revenues grew by 9% and 24%, respectively, in Q3. Next year should be another strong recovery year for advertising, which will boost both companies. Amazon has also had a strong 2023, with its margins rising. However, this chart doesn't tell the full story, as this takes into account Amazon's profits over the past 12 months. If you focus on its latest quarterly results, Amazon's margins are nearing (or have already set) all-time highs. AMZN Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly)data byYCharts. The fact that Amazon posted solid results in historically weak quarters bodes well for Q4, which is usually its strongest one. No investor knows what a fully profitable Amazon looks like, but 2024 could give us a glimpse,making it a strong buy now.

Become a Motley Fool member today toget instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources,and more.Learn More The ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks have varying valuations. Four have room to run, and three have gotten too rich. Any investing exposure to the""Magnificent Seven"" stockshas made your 2023 investing year a big success. This group of mega-cap tech stocks, includingNvidia(NVDA2.98%),Amazon(AMZN0.35%),Tesla(TSLA1.09%),Apple(AAPL0.49%),Microsoft(MSFT-0.58%),Meta Platforms(META0.03%), andAlphabet(GOOG0.34%)(GOOGL0.39%), has outperformed the broader market despite theNasdaq Compositesurging over 45% last year. If it's not broken, don't fix it... right? Well, not exactly. A look at the numbers signals that some of these genuinely magnificent stocks could soon run out of steam. Here are the four stocks in this group worth buying in 2024, and the three to leave behind in 2023. Nvidia's chips, which specialize in demanding, high-compute applications, have become a focal point of theartificial intelligence (AI)breakthrough. The company has quickly established dominance, controlling as much as 90% of the market for AI chips. That's pushed the business to new heights, accelerating revenue growth to 200% year over year in its most recent quarter to $18 billion. AI demand doesn't seem to be going anywhere, which should create plenty of growth for Nvidia moving forward. Analysts believe the company's earnings will grow by 42% annually over the coming years, arguably justifying Nvidia's valuation at 40 times 2023 profits. That's aPEG ratioof just 1, signaling the stock is still attractive despite its massive 250% climb in 2023. Not every ""Magnificent Seven"" company has grown enough to keep up with its stock. Apple's revenue has fallen over the past year, and net income is up just 1%. Apple's business can becyclical, gyrating between periods of growth depending on key iPhone releases. That's fine, but it can complicate things when share prices and operating results go in different directions. Analysts have lowered their growth expectations for Apple moving forward. At more than 29 times 2023 earnings, that PEG ratio over 3 makes buying Apple here a tough pill to swallow. Investors should wait for the price to make sense again. Astonishingly, the stock is still attractive at just 25 times 2023 earnings, with expected annual growth of 20% on average moving forward. It turns out that Meta isstill a great business, and Wall Street forgot that in a big way. The rally in 2023 undid the pessimism, but there is still room for the growth Meta can achieve in 2024 and beyond. ChatGPT was a viral sensation in 2023, and Microsoft swiftly jumped in, tying itself to its creator, OpenAI, with a multibillion-dollar investment and extended partnership. Between enterprise software, cloud computing, gaming, and more, Microsoft is one of the world's largest and most diversified technology companies. Its cloud positioning amid the AI opportunity has seemingly boosted analyst expectations for its earnings growth in the coming years. Mid-teens growth is nothing to dismiss, but it's becoming harder to call Microsoft a growth stock at its whopping $2.8 trillionmarket cap. At a forward P/E over 33, the stock's resulting PEG ratio over 2 isn't as appealing as some other ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks. It's notabhorrently expensive, but after its 57% single-year gallop,there are better deals out there. It's OK for investors to be picky. Interestingly, e-commerce and cloud leader Amazon trades at a similar PEG ratio to Microsoft of just over 2. So, why should investors consider buying Amazon over similarly valued Microsoft? Amazon is famous for investing its profits into the business, which can understate its true profit potential. The stock trades at 57 times its bottom-line earnings but just 22 times its operating profits, which are earnings from day-to-day business. Over the past decade, that's over 20% below Amazon's average price-to-cash-from-operations ratio. Amazon has tons going on, including investing indeveloping its AI technology, a critical ingredient to its future. That's not touching on e-commerce, which still has room to grow over the coming decades (e-commerce is just 15% of U.S. retail). Electric vehicle and energy company Tesla is another example of share price and fundamentals heading in opposite directions. Tesla began cutting prices in 2023 to boost unit sales. The idea is that more units made and sold will let Tesla lower its prices, a cycle that will price competitors out of the market. It's a bold move that has brought short-term consequences to Tesla's operating results.Gross profit marginis down 22% over the past year. Hopefully, unit sales will grow enough for Tesla to realize the cost savings it's striving for soon. Analysts have aggressively lowered their expectations for Tesla's future earnings growth due to the price cuts. If analysts are correct, Tesla's stock has become far more pricey at a PEG ratio over 4. After the stock ran 130% last year, investors might be better off waiting to buy until the numbers prove Tesla right in its price-cutting strategy. Alphabet's dominance with Google and YouTube overshadows its behind-the-scenes AI potential. The company isleaning on AIto help customers maximize their advertising spend on its platforms (how Alphabet makes most of its money). Its massive pile of user data and pole position among the world's most trafficked websites makes Alphabet a boring but effective money-printing machine. The company spends much of that cash flow buying back tons of stock, lowering the number ofoutstanding sharesby 10% in the past five years. That recipe of growth and buybacks has analysts expecting earnings to compound at over 17% annually. The stock's 57% run in 2023 has raised its valuation, but it remains a solid deal for long-term investors at a PEG ratio of 1.4.

technology sector, posted solid gains in 2023, boosted by
optimism over artificial intelligence, that inflation was
peaking and on hopes for further economic stimulus from central
banks. Facebook parent Meta Platforms experienced a
substantial increase in market capitalization, soaring 188% to
$909.3 billion, its largest annual gain in 11 years. Nvidia Corp
, the U.S. chipmaker, skyrocketed 240% in terms of
market cap, to $1.22 trillion – its biggest yearly gain since
2001. Electric vehicle giant Tesla also saw significant
growth, with its market value doubling to $789 billion by the
end of December. This increase was propelled by enthusiasm over
its self-driving software and a record number of vehicle
deliveries in the final quarter of the year. Tech leaders Apple and Microsoft
maintained their positions at the top, with market
capitalizations of $2.99 trillion and $2.79 trillion,
respectively, leading the pack in terms of overall value. However, the substantial gains among these mega-cap stocks
have led some analysts to deem them overvalued, with
expectations for a more widespread rally in the coming year.
This broader market uplift is anticipated to be supported by
potential rate cuts from global central banks this year,
analysts said. (Reporting By Patturaja Murugaboopathy and Gaurav Dogra in

       from The Motley Fool's Premium Investing Services. Become a Motley Fool member today toget instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources,and more.Learn More Nvidia and Meta Platforms crushed the other 498 stocks in the S&P 500 last year. 2023 is now in the books, and it exceeded almost all expectations from an investment perspective. Coming into the year, these were the price targets for theS&P 500index among some of Wall Street's top investment banks: The index officially closed 2023 at 4,769! It marked a 26.3% return including dividends, and it was led higher by two technology giants that each logged triple-digit percentage gains for entirely different reasons. Meta Platforms(META0.08%)stock surged on the back of a spectacular earnings recovery, butNvidia(NVDA3.10%)topped the charts thanks to its data center chips designed for artificial intelligence (AI) workloads. I'll share the details below and highlight why these two stocks probably aren't done moving higher. Meta Platforms entered 2023 with a stock price of $120, which was 69% below its all-time high. It set a seven-year low of $90 just a few months earlier, because investors were growing impatient with CEOMark Zuckerberg's strategy to focus on virtual reality and the metaverse. All the while, new social media platforms like TikTok were stealing advertising dollars away from Meta's core assets Facebook and Instagram. The stock-price slide prompted Zuckerberg to declare 2023 the ""year of efficiency."" He quickly slashed 21,000 jobs and committed to cutting costs across the board, and he even moderated spending on metaverse projects which were only generating tiny amounts of revenue. Zuckerberg also shifted the company's focus back to its social media assets. Meta aggressively invested inartificial intelligence, which can learn what content users enjoy viewing and feed them more of it to make their experience more relevant. Through the first nine months of 2023 alone, Zuckerberg saidAI-powered content recommendations drove a 6% increase in the amount of time users spent on Instagram, and a 7% increase on Facebook. That gives Meta more opportunities to show ads to users, which in turn drives more revenue. The ad market also bounced back in 2023 following a dismal 2022, when businesses cut their spending amiduncertain economic conditions. Those combined factors drove Meta's revenue to a quarterly record-high of $34.1 billion in the third quarter of 2023 (ended Sept. 30). Meta'searnings per share(profit) also soared 167% year over year to $4.39 in Q3, helped along by cost cuts. The company is on track to deliver $12.92 in total earnings per share for 2023, pending its fourth-quarter results. Considering Meta stock closed the year at $353.96, it trades at aprice-to-earnings (P/E) ratioof 27.4, assuming its final results come in as expected. That's a 9% discount to the 30.1 P/E of theNasdaq-100technology index, signaling 2024 could bring more upside for Meta's investors. But it gets better. Wall Street predicts the company's earnings will hit a record high of $15.78 in the year ahead, placing its stock at a forward P/E of 22.4. If that earnings forecast proves correct, Meta stock will have to rise 34% by the end of 2024 just to trade in line with the current P/E ratio of the Nasdaq-100. Meta's 2023 return was spectacular, but the biggest gainer in the S&P 500 was Nvidia. The company delivered some of the best operating results Wall Street has ever seen, sending its stock a whopping 239% higher for the year. Nvidia cemented itself as the biggest name in artificial intelligence last year, and it probably won't lose that title anytime soon. AI whipped the corporate world into a frenzy. Applications like OpenAI'sChatGPTcan instantly create text, images, videos, and even computer code, which has the potential to drive a productivity boom. Developing, training, and deploying those AI applications happens in the data center, and Nvidia's graphics processing chips (GPUs) are the beating heart of that infrastructure. Nvidia is currently in its fiscal 2024 year, which ends Jan. 30, 2024. Through the first three quarters, the company generated $29.1 billion in data center revenue alone, which marked a 155% increase from the year-ago period. In early 2023,HSBCestimated Nvidia had a 90% share in the market for AI data center chips, which afforded it unprecedented pricing power. Its leading H100 GPUs are known to sell for $40,000 apiece. As a result, Nvidia'sgross profit margincurrently sits at a record high of 74%, sending its earnings per share soaring 599% through the first three quarters of fiscal 2024. Nvidia would have done even better if not for supply shortages. It simply can't produce chips fast enough to meet demand; cloud providers likeMicrosoftAzure,AmazonWeb Services, andAlphabet's Google Cloud are racing to fill their data centers with the company's hardware.Oracleis currently building 100 new data centers on top of the 66 it already operates. Nvidia recently launched its new H200 data center chip. It can speed up AI model inferencing (teaching it to make live predictions) twofold compared to the H100, while consuming half the amount of energy. That's music to the ears of data center operators, because it could drive more revenue with lower operating costs. Wall Street already predicts Nvidia's revenue and earnings will surge 56% and 59%, respectively, in the upcoming fiscal 2025 year. That bodes well formore upside in its stock during calendar 2024.

Become a Motley Fool member today toget instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources,and more.Learn More Both companies are in a position to feel a boost from emerging technologies. Growth stocks are known for their potential to rapidly increase in value. They come with a risk-reward trade-off, but for investors who can stomach the volatility that typically comes with them, growth stocks can be real moneymakers over time. Not allgrowth stockshave to be speculative or high-risk, either. Some growth stocks also provide investors with relative stability. If you have $5,000 to invest, the following two growth stocks are great options because of their market-beating potential. Amazon(AMZN0.43%)has been one of the stock market's quintessential growth stocks for quite some time. A $10,000 investment at its May 1997 initial public offering would be worth over $15.5 million today. You can't ask for much more growth than that. Even with its generational returns, Amazon is well positioned to continue growing at a good rate. Of course, itse-commercebusiness made it a household name, but Amazon has its hand in several industries that are still growing, including artificial intelligence, healthcare, and cloud services. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is Amazon's true moneymaker, accounting for most of its profit. AWS is the leading cloud service provider, with a 31% market share as of the third quarter of 2023. That's a 1% drop from recent quarters, but I don't believe that's a cause for concern. The cloud computing market is projected to have a compound annual growth rate of 17.8% from 2023 to 2032, according to Acumen Research and Consulting. Even growing at that rate could expand AWS and boost Amazon's profits. Amazon Prime Video could be an underrated growth area for Amazon. Although it has been around since September 2006, recent moves such as buying the rights to the NFL's Thursday Night Football and investing heavily in expanding its original content have put Amazon Prime Video in a competitive position. Amazon received some backlash when it announced it would begin showing ads on Amazon Prime Video (or you can pay $2.99 per month to avoid ads), but I don't see that having a tangible effect on its growth. Realistically, it was only a matter of time. Having access to your shopping data and then being able to show you relevant ads on Amazon Prime Video is the type of integration that I'm sure Amazon has been seeking. Its e-commerce business could see an assist from the move. Google's parent company,Alphabet(GOOGL0.48%)(GOOG0.41%), didn't have the monster year that big tech growth stocks such asNvidiaor Amazon had, but you can't beat 58% returns in a year. Google advertising is undoubtedly Alphabet's most important business, accounting for more than 77% of its revenue in the third quarter of 2023. That's less than the 80% it accounted for three years ago, showing that other segments such as cloud and ""Other Bets"" (which includes Waymo) are beginning to pick up steam. Google Cloud has grown impressively, making up 11% of Alphabet's revenue in the third quarter. It's still firmly in third place in cloud service market share (11%), trailing AWS andMicrosoft's Azure, but this is a notable increase from its 6% market share in 2017. Much like AWS, Google Cloud should see a boost from overall industry growth in the coming years. There's also an argument to be made that Alphabet stock is currently undervalued, especially when you look at thefree cash flowthe company generates. Its free cash flow outpaces tech giants such as Microsoft, Nvidia, and Amazon. This gives Alphabet plenty of cash leeway to invest aggressively in emerging technologies, make strategic acquisitions, and repurchase shares. With a price-to-free cash flow ratio of around 23.5, Alphabet trades at a significant discount to its peers. There may be legitimate concerns about Alphabet's reliance on Google advertising and antitrust scrutiny, but Alphabet is still positioned to return significant shareholder value for the foreseeable future.

Become a Motley Fool member today toget instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources,and more.Learn More The company has one of the most powerful positions in tech, yet remains the cheapest option in the ""Magnificent Seven."" Tech stocks surged in 2023, with the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index up 67% over the last 12 months. Excitement over budding markets like artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing has made Wall Street bullish, as both have significant growth potential in the coming years. As a result, a company likeAlphabet(GOOG0.41%)(GOOGL0.48%), with its vast financial resources and dominance in multiple areas of tech, is a compelling investment. Alphabet used its Google brand to branch out to several markets, becoming a titan of digital advertising and heavily investing in AI. The tech firm's success has seen its annual revenue soar 107% over the last five years, with operating income up 130%. The ever-expanding nature of the tech market will likely keep its earnings trending up over the long term. So, here's why it's not too late to buy Alphabet stock, with the company an attractive option for the new year. Alphabet claimed a powerful position in tech when it landed on the scene with Google, which has seen it retain more than an 80% market share in search engines for years. The potency of Google in the consumer market and its vast user base has presented almost endless growth opportunities, with Alphabet strategically using it to build a lucrative advertising business. According to Statista, digital ads are a $680 billion industry, with Alphabet responsible for 25% of the market. Alongside Google Search, Android, and YouTube, the company owes over 80% of its revenue to ads, which continue to deliver significant gains. In the third quarter of 2023, Alphabet posted revenue growth of 11% year over year, beating analysts' expectations by $980 million after considerable rises in its Google Search and YouTube segments. Google is easily one of the world's most recognizable brands, with the company attaching the name to many of its ventures into other industries. In this way, Alphabet has seen success in cloud computing, productivity software, web browsers, and more. Its Google Cloud platform has shown significant promise, posting revenue growth of 23% year over year in Q3 2023. Google Cloud is the third-largest cloud platform, afterAmazonWeb Services andMicrosoft's Azure, but it is rapidly expanding. Alphabet's heavy investment in AI over the last year will likely see it add more AI features to Google Cloud alongside similar updates to its other services. Alphabet hit $78 billion in free cash flow in 2023, outperforming Amazon and Microsoft. The tech giant has the funds to fuel its research and development and go far in AI and tech in general. Its shares have risen 172% in the last five years and could soar further over the next half-decade on its current trajectory. Alphabet has been slightly overlooked this year, with AI expansions from other companies in the ""Magnificent Seven"" group stealing the spotlight. The company's shares have climbed 59% this year, which is impressive. However, it doesn't come close to the triple-digit growth some of its peers have delivered. As a result, Alphabet remains one of the best bargains in big tech. Data byYCharts. PE Ratio = price-to-earnings ratio. These charts compare theprice-to-earnings ratiosand price to free cash flows of the Magnificent Seven, with Alphabet's figures the lowest on both fronts. The Google company's lower valuation metrics indicate its stock is the cheapest option of these companies. These stocks are the biggest names in tech and will likely make valuable additions to any portfolio over the long term. It's a smart move to dedicate a significant portion of your holdings to at least one of these companies. Meanwhile, Alphabet's dominance in tech, expansion in AI, considerable cash reserves, and reasonable stock price prove it's not too late to invest in this tech giant.

Become a Motley Fool member today toget instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources,and more.Learn More While artificial intelligence (AI) is all the rage this year, this company has infused the technology into its operations for years. The investing conditions that characterized 2022 were among the most challenging in recent memory, but the economic landscape has shifted. After plummeting more than 35% in 2022, theNasdaq Compositecame roaring back in 2023, up 43%. Yet history says the rally could continue into 2024. Records going back to 1972 -- the first full year the Nasdaq traded -- show that in every yearfollowinga market rebound, the tech-heavy index has risen 19%, on average, which suggests there could be more to come. The economy remains the wild card, and things could certainly change for the worse, which is something to keep in mind. Helping propel the market gains this year are a group of investor favorite stocks collectively known as the ""Magnificent Seven,"" which have outperformed the broader market by a landslide: The link between these tech behemoths isartificial intelligence (AI). Most market watchers acknowledge this was the catalyst that sparked the 2023 market rally, which has investors looking to capitalize on this once-in-a-generation opportunity. One company that represents an intriguing possibility is Meta Platforms. While the stock was a standout performer in 2023, there could be much more to come. Some investors might point to the fact that Meta Platforms nearly tripled last year as a reason to avoid the stock, but that needs to be viewed in context. The macroeconomic headwinds of the past couple of years affected many companies, but Meta Platforms was hit particularly hard. The lion's share of the company's revenue comes from thedigital advertisingshown on its family of social media sites. The period was characterized by reduced marketing budgets, as ad spending can be dialed back or ramped up on short notice, generally without serious repercussions for the business. Meta is the world's second-largest online advertising platform, representing roughly 20% of the market, so the business was especially vulnerable to the economic environment. As a result, Meta Platforms experienced its first year-over-year revenue decline in company history. The stock plunged, losing as much as 74% of its value. This year's rebound merely brought the stock back to where it was before being crushed by the downturn. Meta Platforms' rebound has been nothing short of astonishing, but its financial results underpin its recovery. In the third quarter, revenue of $94.8 billion climbed 23% year over year. Perhaps as importantly, the company's cost-cutting campaign reduced expenses by 7%, dropping more to the bottom line. As a result, earnings per share of $4.39 represented a 168% increase, which illustrates how Meta was able to leverage its reduced cost structure. Backstopping the financial results was a strong business performance. In September, 3.14 billion people visited one of Meta's social media sites, up 7% year over year, while 3.96 billion stopped by every month as of September, also up 7%. This performance provides plenty of opportunity to expand the online advertising that fuels Meta's growth. Meta has long used AI to enhance its business. The most obvious consumer-facing uses included identifying people in photos posted on the site and surfacing relevant content and advertising for users. Meta has made no secret of its plans to unleash generative AI to further advance its agenda. Earlier this year, Meta launched a suite offreeAI-powered marketing tools for merchants that advertise on its social media sites. The company's Ads Manager can customize images and text to help merchants better reach their target audience. These tools will help them generate backgrounds, adjust the aspect ratio to accommodate different advertising mediums, and more. The vast treasure trove of user data and years of platform history provided Meta with everything it needed to generate its own large language model, which forms the foundation for generative AI. While Meta doesn't have the advantage of a cloud distribution platform, it quickly made its Llama AI available on each of the major cloud infrastructure services, including Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure -- for a fee. This was a brilliant way to stake a claim in the AI revolution, especially since it adds an entirely new revenue stream to fill Meta's coffers. Meta is currently selling for 25 times forward earnings, a slight discount to theS&P 500. What's more, at roughly 6 times sales, it's a discount to its seven-year average of nearly 9 times sales. While the stock is no longer the screaming buy it was last year, it's still remarkably cheap given its prospects. The rebound of the advertising market has already begun, but things are looking up for 2024. After rising 5.5% in 2023, global ad spending is expected to increase by 7.2% in 2024, according to industry strategist Magna Global. As one of the world's largest digital advertisers, Meta is well-positioned to ride that wave. Given the improving ad market, its position in the industry, and its relatively inexpensive stock price, I'd suggest now is the time to buy Meta as the tech rally appears likely to continue in 2024.

Become a Motley Fool member today toget instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources,and more.Learn More These companies have massive potential in AI over the next year and look too good to pass up. The artificial intelligence (AI) market exploded in 2023 and shows no signs of slowing. The debut of ChatGPT reignited interest in the sector and forced many to rethink what they thought was currently possible with the technology. As a result, countless companies pivoted their businesses to developing the industry. Data from Grand View Research shows the AI market is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% through 2030. That would see it hit annual sales exceeding $1 trillion before the decade's end. That makes now a great time to invest in this rapidly expanding industry and potentially profit from its promising outlook. Here are three AI stocks you might want to consider buying hand over fist in January. Advanced Micro Devices(AMD-0.54%)has an exciting year ahead, with plans to strengthen its role in AI by launching a new chip. The company will begin shipping its MI300X graphics processing unit (GPU) in 2024, designed specifically to challengeNvidia's dominance. Nvidia soared to the top of the market in 2023, getting a headstart as it snapped up an estimated 90% market share in AI chips. Its success in the industry highlighted how far chipmakers like AMD are behind when it comes to AI. However, AMD spent the last 12 months refining its AI technology and it's hoping to make a big splash in the sector this year. As the cost of AI chips rises, the industry is desperate for increased competition and alternatives to Nvidia. Consequently, AMD's MI300X has support from firms across tech, withMicrosoft's Azure announcing in December that it will become the first cloud platform to use the new GPU to optimize its AI offerings. The chart above shows AMD's earnings could hit $5 per share by fiscal 2025. When that figure is multiplied by the company'sforward price-to-earnings ratioof 55, it gives a stock price of $275, suggesting growth of 87% over the next two fiscal years. AMD is on a promising growth trajectory and could be one of the smartest investments this month. Like AMD,Intel(INTC-2.56%)is hard at work designing a new AI chip to take on Nvidia in 2024. In December the company unveiled several new additions to its product lineup, including the Gaudi3, which is launching this year and is capable of powering demanding AI models. Intel has transformed itself over the last few years. A long history of dominance in central processing units (CPUs) saw it grow complacent, leaving it vulnerable to competition. Its CPU market share fell from 82% to 61% between 2017 and 2023 as AMD strengthened its position in the industry. Then in 2020,Appleended its partnership with Intel in favor of in-house hardware, taking a significant bite out of the chipmaker's earnings. However, instead of throwing in the towel, the hurdles seemed to light a fire under Intel again. The company unveiled its first consumer GPUs in October 2022, venturing into a new market that would see it go head-to-head with Nvidia and AMD. The move was a smart one in the run-up to the boom in AI, as GPU technology is crucial to its success in the industry over the long term. Intel's massive growth potential is evident in its EPS estimates. This chart shows its earnings are projected to reach nearly $3 per share over the next two fiscal years. In a similar calculation to AMD, multiplying the figure by Intel's forward P/E of 53 yields a stock price of $140. If the estimates hold, the company's shares would deliver growth of 180% by fiscal 2025. As a result, Intel is absolutely an AI stock worth buying hand over fist this January. Alphabet(GOOG0.41%)(GOOGL0.54%)enjoyed a glowing 2023. Its digital ad business made an impressive turnaround from the previous year, with revenue rising 11% year over year in its latest quarter (the third quarter of 2023) as it beat analysts' expectations by $980 million. Meanwhile, the tech giant has exciting prospects in AI. Alphabet's highly anticipated large language model Gemini debuted in early December, and is capable of crunching various forms of data with more sophisticated reasoning than any of the company's previous technology. Gemini and Alphabet's potent platforms, like Google Search and Android, could prove a powerful combination, presenting countless ways for the company to expand in AI. Alongside free cash flow that rose 29% over the last year to $77 billion, Alphabet has the financial resources and brand loyalty to go far in the industry. Alphabet's biggest competitors in AI are cloud giantsAmazonand Microsoft. However, Gemini and Alphabet's massive user base suggests the company has equal, if not more, earnings potential in AI. Meanwhile, this chart shows Alphabet's P/E and price-to-free cash flow are significantly lower than those of its rivals, making its stock a bargain compared to Amazon and Microsoft. Alphabet likely has a bright future in AI and is a no-brainer investment this month.
