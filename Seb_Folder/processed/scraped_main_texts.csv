1,"Every week, Benzinga conducts a sentiment survey to find out what traders are most excited about, interested in or thinking about as they manage and build their personal portfolios. We surveyed a group of over 500 investors on whether shares of Shopify Inc SHOP will reach $2,000 by 2022.  Shopify offers an e-commerce platform primarily to small and midsize businesses. The e-commerce company has two leading segments that drive revenue: subscriptions and merchant solutions. The subscription solutions segment allows Shopify merchants to conduct e-commerce on a variety of platforms, including the company's website, physical stores, pop-up stores, kiosks and social networks. Merchant solutions are defined as add-on products for the platform that facilitate e-commerce and include Shopify Payments, Shopify Shipping and Shopify Capital. The company’s main e-commerce stock competitors include Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd - ADR BABA and Etsy Inc ETSY. Of the Benzinga traders and investors surveyed, 67% told us Shopify would reach $2,000 per share by the end of next year. Respondents said Shopify will continue to see strength in 2021 off continued nationwide adoption of online shopping, away from traditional brick and mortar retailers. Traders also said that even with nationwide distribution of a coronavirus vaccine already underway, the popularity of e-commerce will continue to grow. They believe American consumers like being able to shop a variety of merchants simultaneously and have their purchases delivered to their front door. Many traders and investors also said they are keen on Shopify's UI/UX, noting how the platform has a high ease-of-access for small and midsize retailers looking to take their business online. It should be noted the latest price target for Shopify was reported by Susquehanna on Dec. 2. The analyst firm set a target for $950, expecting shares of the e-commerce company to fall within 12 months.  Going into the end of 2020, Shopify shares were trading lower following the stock's recent surge, which was driven by e-commerce trends and holiday sales optimism. COVID-19 vaccine news has also driven a rotation from e-commerce names into reopening sectors such as traditional retail and travel. Current and prospective investors should take note Shopify’s fourth-quarter earnings date is estimated for Feb. 17. See Also: How To Buy Shopify Stock. This survey was conducted by Benzinga in December 2020 and included the responses of a diverse population of adults 18 or older. Opting into the survey was completely voluntary, with no incentives offered to potential respondents. The study reflects results from over 500 adults. Photo courtesy of Shopify. © 2024 Benzinga.com.

9,"Chinese EV maker Nio Inc – ADR NIO announced record monthly deliveries for December that underlined the strong momentum the company is experiencing. What Happened:  Nio's deliveries climbed 121% year-over-year to 7,007 vehicles in December, the company said in a release Sunday. The total unit deliveries comprised 2,009 ES8S, 2,493 ES6s and 2,505 units of its  newly-launched EC6s. Sequentially, deliveries increased 32.43% from the 5,291 vehicles delivered in November. The company noted that it reported two-fold year-over-year growth for the ninth consecutive month. ""2020 has been a challenging year for the whole world. Against this backdrop, NIO has achieved consecutive record-highs along the way, and closed the year on a high note with remarkable December deliveries of over 7,000 vehicles,"" said William Bin Li, founder, chairman and CEO of NIO in a release. For the fourth quarter, the company delivered 17,353 vehicles, representing a 111% year-over-year increase. The company's earlier guidance had estimated quarterly deliveries would be 16,500 to 17,000 units. Growing recognition of Nio's premium brand, competitive and compelling products and services, and an expanding sales network contributed to the strong performance, the company said in the release. Nio noted that its battery-as-a-service scheme  has been popular among its customers since its launch. After adding an option of providing a 100-kilowatt-hour battery pack, penetration of BaaS reached about 40% of its new orders in December. In 2020, the company delivered 43,728 vehicles, a 112.6% year-over-year increase. Related Link:  Nio To Match Vehicle Prices Through Jan. 10 As China Plans 20% EV Subsidy Cut In 2021   Why It's Important:  Nio, being a homegrown EV startup in China, has slowly and steadily grown mindshare as well as market share in the hot-and-happening Chinese market. The company has pushed ahead to grow as a strong challenger to Tesla Inc TSLA in China. Nio's domestic rival Li Auto Inc. LI reported Friday monthly deliveries of 6,126 Li ONEs, representing a 31.9% month-over-month increase and a 529.6% year-over-year gain. Tesla, which reports numbers by quarter but not by month, said Saturday that its fourth-quarter deliveries came in at 180,570, up 29.6% quarter-over-quarter and 61.2% higher than a year ago. What's Next:  The  2020 Nio Day scheduled  for Jan. 9 is the next upcoming catalyst for the EV maker. Nio confirmed that at the fourth Nio Day it will launch a new sedan model, while also sharing the latest developments in autonomous driving and other core technologies. ""Aspired by the spirit of 'Always Forward,' the theme of the upcoming NIO Day, we will continue investing in the smart EV technologies, accelerating our new products development, broadening our sales and service network, and striving for the best holistic experiences for our growing user community in 2021 and beyond,"" Nio said. The Price Action:  Nio shares, which hit an all-time high of $57.20 on Nov. 24, have pulled back since then amid fears of unsustainable valuation and a regulatory clampdown in China. The stock has managed to regain some of its lost momentum in the past couple of sessions. The deliveries update could lend support to the upside in the run up to the Jan. 9th Nio Day. Thursday, the stock closed at $48.74, up 0.74%. Related Link:  Why Nio Has A Shot At Becoming The 'Tesla Of China'  Photo courtesy Nio © 2024 Benzinga.com.

10,"In line with its emphasis on service and support, Nio Inc – ADR NIO has announced the launch of a used care service in its home market of China. What Happened:  Nio officially launched on Sunday a pre-owned service called Nio Certified for buyers of used Nio cars. The company plans an investment of 3 billion yuan ($459.21 million) into this service over five years. ""The launch of NIO Certified marked the closure of the service loop throughout the life cycle of NIO cars,"" the company said in a statement.
The implementation comes after six months of trial operation, it added. Nio noted that as of Dec. 31, 2020, it had delivered a cumulative 75,641 vehicles through the trial program, with the total mileage exceeding 1.4 billion kilometers. How The Used Car Service Works:  Nio said it has established a nationwide used car business network, providing a full-range of services including vehicle inspection, evaluation, acquisition and sales. The company said it offers competitive rates and fast transactions. All pre-owned cars from NIO Certified have passed 286 tests designed for new energy vehicles and come with traceable vehicle information, the company said. Related Link:  Nio To Match Vehicle Prices Through Jan. 10 As China Plans 20% EV Subsidy Cut In 2021  NIO Certified allows buyers to return their cars or ask for replacement within seven days after purchase. The cars bought through the service come with other freebies such as an extended warranty from the manufacturer for one year or 30,000 kilometers from the date of purchase, a free 7 kW Power Home, lifetime free roadside rescue, lifetime free car connectivity and the same battery-as-a-service program that comes with a new car. Nio also provides authentic part replacements in used cars, and updates their software and hardware before delivery. Battery swaps ensure the health of batteries available in the service network, the company said.
NIO Certified also offers benefits for repurchase, including NIO value point rewards, battery upgrades at a 40% discount, and discounts for Nio Pilot and autonomous driving packages. Why It's Important:  NIO Certified is seen as a move to accelerate the company's sales momentum, especially at a time when bigger rival Tesla Inc TSLA has begun to sell its China-made Model Y at a discounted price relative to imported models. Nio  reported  for December 121% year-over-year increase in deliveries, topping off a year that saw the company rebounding strongly from a COVID-19-induced downturn in the first two months of the year.

11,"Every week, Benzinga conducts a sentiment survey to find out what traders are most excited about, interested in or thinking about as they manage and build their personal portfolios. We surveyed a group of over 500 investors on whether the Invesco QQQ Index ETF QQQ will reach $400 by 2022.  ETF stands for exchange-traded fund. An ETF is an investment fund whose shares trade on a stock exchange just like stocks for individual companies.  ETFs track an index or sector, represent a commodity (like gold, oil or wheat) or sample a basket of stocks or bonds that meet given criteria. Exchange-traded funds are popular with investors given they can help mitigate risk in a portfolio. The QQQ ETF tracks the NASDAQ 100, which includes 100 of the largest domestic and international nonfinancial companies listed on the Nasdaq exchange based on market capitalization. The fund and the index are rebalanced quarterly and reconstituted annually. With 48% of QQQ’s weighted allocation stemming from the information technology sector, it’s no surprise that after hitting a 2020 low of $165 in March, QQQ closed 2020 just shy of $314. As of publishing, QQQ’s five largest holdings are Apple Inc AAPL (13.39% of allocation), Microsoft Corporation MSFT (10.76%), Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN (10.66%), Facebook, Inc. Common Stock FB (4.26%) and Tesla Inc TSLA (3.45%). In our survey, 63% of Benzinga traders and investors said the QQQ ETF would reach $400 by the end of 2021. Being that QQQ representation is heavily dependent on and allocated towards tech, healthcare and consumer services, investors told us they believe the ETF will grow alongside an improving US economy in 2021, as well as a continued surge in demand and interest for the ETF’s most popular stocks — Tesla, Apple and Amazon. Respondents also believe QQQ will see strength throughout 2021 given that the sector allocation of the ETF’s NASDAQ-100 representation is dominated by information technology (48%), communication services (19%) and consumer discretionary (19%) stocks. If the US economy were to improve throughout 2021, it can be said that information techology, communication services and consumer discretionary sectors stand to gain the most in the coming months.

15,"Bitcoin (BTC) price reached another all-time high — $34,000 in the early hours of Sunday (EST), marking the cryptocurrency network's 12th anniversary, known as Genesis Day. What Happened: On Jan. 9, 2009, the first bitcoin block, called block number 0, was mined by Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin. The crypto community celebrates the leading digital currency birthday twice a year — on Jan. 3 and also on Oct. 31, the anniversary of the Bitcoin white paper published by Satoshi in 2008. Jan. 3 is also known as the Proof of Keys celebration, an event suggested by long-time bitcoiner Trace Mayer.  The motto behind the celebration is “Not your keys; not your Bitcoin,” and the proper way to celebrate it is to “test trust” by withdrawing all bitcoins to wallets users control ""that perform network consensus and use best practices,” the Proof of Keys celebration site suggests. The idea is to demonstrate the robustness of the Bitcoin system. Why It Matters: The price of Bitcoin has had a bull run, reaching new highs throughout December and breaking the $20,000 mark on Dec. 16. It soared past $30,000 to briefly touch $33,000 around midday EST yesterday. It then fell to $30,500 levels for a while, according to TradingView data. BTC was trading at $33,477.93 late in the morning Sunday. What’s Next: Traders and analysts have been optimistic about the future of the BItcoin price, with some saying it “should be worth about $400,000.” Analyst Jim Bianco compared the rally to Tesla Inc TSLA stock performance, saying, “Bitcoin makes TSLA look like it is standing still.” © 2024 Benzinga.com.

16,"Shareholders are scheduled to vote on the merger between Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV FCAU and PSA Group on Monday. Sizing Up: Finalization of the merger, which has been in the works for years, would create the world's fourth largest automaker by volume, Bloomberg reported. The combined new company, called Stellantis, includes the brands Fiat, Jeep, Dodge, Ram and Maserati, Peugeot, Opel and DS. The companies agreed to the $50 billion all-share deal in December 2019. The brands will keep their badges and logos, Reuters reported earlier. Why It Matters: The company expects its greater scale to give it an edge in an industry undergoing vehicle electrification with Tesla Inc TSLA gaining all the spotlight, and facing challengers from outside, including possibly Apple Inc AAPL. But the auto industry has a mixed record of results from big mergers, including one of the brands involved in this one — Chrysler. Daimler-Benz's purchase of Chrysler in 1998 is the classic example that merger skeptics point to as evidence that scale doesn't always work in the industry. PSA Chief Executive Officer Carlos Tavares is expected to take on the task of cutting costs at Stellantis. He ""takes a Darwinian view on the industry, arguing that only the strong carmakers will survive the pivot to electric drivetrains and pursuit of autonomous driving,"" Bloomberg reported. His experience in reviving PSA and the brand Opel are pointed to as encouraging signs that he can manage the transformational challenges the company faces. Recent Trading Action: Shares of Fiat ended the last trading week of 2020 up 1.74% at $18.09. PSA Group trades as Peugeot SA on the Euronext Paris exchange and ended the week down 0.49% at €22.37.   © 2024 Benzinga.com. Benzinga does not provide investment advice. All rights reserved.

Daimler-Benz's purchase of Chrysler in 1998 is the classic example that merger skeptics point to as evidence that scale doesn't always work in the industry. PSA Chief Executive Officer Carlos Tavares is expected to take on the task of cutting costs at Stellantis. He ""takes a Darwinian view on the industry, arguing that only the strong carmakers will survive the pivot to electric drivetrains and pursuit of autonomous driving,"" Bloomberg reported. His experience in reviving PSA and the brand Opel are pointed to as encouraging signs that he can manage the transformational challenges the company faces.

18,"Tesla Inc's TSLA popular Model Y all electric crossover will start deliveries in China, Reuters reports. What Happened: Tesla is selling the Model Y at a starting price of about $52,000, compared with a $49,990 starting price in the US. The Model Y is being made in an expansion to Tesla's Gigafactory Shanghai. Why It Matters: The Chinese market is a key one for the automaker as, besides its large size, it also comes with heavy subsidies for electric vehicle purchases. Bloomberg reported that although the Model Y does not qualify for the subsidies (unlike Tesla's Model 3), Tesla has priced the Model Y at less than its domestic rivals' models. Domestic competitors include Nio Inc - ADR NIO, Li Auto Inc. LI and Xpeng Inc - ADR XPEV. Its phenomenal 743% stock price rise in 2020 was based in part on expectations for its growth potential in China. ""We believe China (coming off what looks like a robust November/December) could see eye popping demand into 2021 and 2022 across the board with Tesla's flagship Giga 3 footprint a major competitive advantage,"" said Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives on Saturday upon the release of Tesla's fourth quarter delivery results.

19,"What Happened: Ethereum (ETH), the second leading cryptocurrency by market cap, has gained over 18.19% in the last 24 hours and was trading at $951.85 at press time, with a current capitalization at over $103 billion. The price of ETH has been going up since Dec. 24, just after it fell to $572, according to TradingView data. Its all-time high was reached in January 2018, when the price soared to $1,432. Gemini crypto exchange founder and billionaire Cameron Winklevoss touted Ethereum's strength in a tweet on Friday.   $ETH was the best performing asset (up 450%) of 2020 hands down and still below its all-time high. Today it’s the equivalent of 15K #Bitcoin I would take that bet all day long What Happened To Dogecoin: Meanwhile, after its 125% meteoric rise in one day yesterday, Dogecoin (DOGE) was trading at $0.0106 at press time, down 10% since the high of $0.0133 that it hit Saturday. Dogecoin is currently ranked 26th among 8,164 cryptocurrencies in circulation, according to CoinMarketCap. It previously rose 20% after Tesla Inc TSLA CEO Elon Musk tweeted about it on Dec. 20. Total Crypto Market: Overall, the cryptocurrency market capitalization has reached $873 billion as of today, with the top ten cryptocurrencies in the green at press time, including Tether (USDT), XRP, Litecoin (LTC) and Polkadot (DOT).

21,"Loup Ventures analyst Gene Munster said Sunday that Tesla Inc’s TSLA delivery growth rate will continue to see an upward momentum this year and outpace that of most auto companies. What Happened: Munster expects the Elon Musk-led company’s delivery growth rate in 2021 to be in the region of 40% on a year-on-year basis. The rate of growth will outpace those of other auto companies by four-to-five times but would still be less than the Wall Street’s consensus of 57% growth, or 784,800 vehicles, the analyst noted.  Muster expects the “production road"" for Tesla to be ""bumpy — ” adding risk to Tesla’s ability to make cars fast enough in 2021 to meet analyst estimates — but the analyst added, “It does not change our view that Tesla is best-positioned to have leading EV global market share over the next decade.” Tesla will need to hasten the development of its Austin and Berlin manufacturing facilities to keep up with the demand. ""While they made it look easy in Shanghai, ramping production is difficult and will be one of the most important Tesla topics in 2021, along with the status of FSD,"" Munster said. Why It Matters: Traditional automakers are in a Catch 22 bind, as per Munster who sees only two options for the legacy firms. One option is to release a car with all the features and range of a Tesla and sell it at cost, which would lead to erosion of market share and softening of demand. Another is to subsidize vehicles in order to gain market share from Tesla, but with a limited “margin cushion” it would mean bleeding money with increasing sales. “Taking it to the logical end, we believe car companies that have been around for 50+ years will eventually (10 years from now) be forced to restructure or go out of business,” wrote Munster. Over the weekend, Tesla reported it fell just 450 vehicles short of delivering 500,000 units in 2020. The automaker beat Street estimates of 481,261 vehicles. Price Action: Tesla shares closed nearly 1.6% higher at $705.67 on Thursday and fell 0.17% in the after-hours session.

22,"Xpeng Inc XPEV electric vehicle deliveries rose 112% on a year-over-year basis in 2020, the company said Sunday. What Happened: The Guangzhou, China-based EV firm said total deliveries for the year ended Dec 31, 2020, reached 27,041 units. The automaker’s mid-sized P7 sedan reached cumulative deliveries of 15,062 units after mass deliveries commenced in June. The company delivered 11,979 of its compact electric G3 sports utility vehicles. For the fourth quarter, Xpeng recorded 12,964 EV deliveries, which is a 303% increase year-over-year and a 51% increase compared to the previous quarter. Monthly deliveries stood at 5,700 units, which is a 326% increase on a year-over-year basis and a 35% increase over November. Why It Matters: Xpeng is attributing increased deliveries to “increasing brand awareness, expanded sales, marketing and supercharging service initiatives across China.” Xpeng said last week that it had partnered with Shenzhen-based Livox to deploy the latter’s lidar technology in the automaker's new 2021 production model. Meanwhile, rival Chinese EV firm Nio Inc NIO said over the weekend it delivered 43,728 vehicles in 2020, representing a 112.6% increase on a year-over-year basis. Segment leader Tesla inc’s TSLA 2020 deliveries fell just shy of the 500,000 mark, beating the Wall Street estimates of 481,261 vehicles. Price Action: Xpeng shares closed nearly 1.3% higher at $42.83 on Thursday and gained almost 1% in the after-hours session.

23,"Samsung Electronics Co Ltd SSNLF announced Monday it would host its “Galaxy Unpacked” event to launch flagship Galaxy S devices on Jan. 14, a month earlier than expected. What Happened: In the past, Samsung unveiled its flagship phones in February, either before or during the Mobile World Congress trade show, and released the devices in March or April, CNET reports. This year, the smartphone maker has picked an early launch date. At the “Galaxy Unpacked” event, Samsung is expected to unveil its newest Galaxy S devices. It will likely have three models, rumored to be the Galaxy S21, S21 Plus, and S21 Ultra, as per CNET. The world’s largest smartphone maker’s teaser video does not reveal any details. Still, leaked images show that the devices are expected to be similar to the Galaxy S20 lineup, except for size, The Verge reports. Why It Matters: Though Samsung was one of the first companies to release a 5G smartphone in 2020, analysts expect Apple Inc AAPL to become the world’s second-biggest 5G vendor after Huawei, putting Samsung at the third spot, CNET noted. Apple’s latest iPhone 12 lineup supports 5G. Samsung reported its highest quarterly revenue in the third quarter in October but the company said it expected intense competition in the fourth quarter. Samsung’s president and head of mobile communications business, TM Roh, said in a December blog post that the company defies a “one size fits all” mobile experience. Roh added that Samsung would expand its foldable smartphone portfolio and make the devices “more accessible to everyone” in 2021.

25,"Apple Inc’s AAPL Taiwanese supplier Foxconn, trading under the name Hon Hai Precision Industry Co, Ltd Group HNHPF is in talks to fund Chinese electric vehicle startup Byton Ltd, reports Bloomberg. What Happened: Foxconn plans to pump $200 million in Byton with hopes of starting mass production of its Byton M-Byte model in the first quarter of 2022. An official announcement of this agreement is expected to be released on Monday. According to Bloomberg’s sources, Foxconn is also reaching out to other Chinese EV makers for potential collaboration opportunities. Why Does It Matter: In mid-October, the Foxconn Chairman Liu Young-way disclosed plans to diversify the company's global investments by venturing into the electric vehicles segment, digital health, and robotics business. Related News: Apple Working On Self-Driving Vehicle Similar To Tesla With TSMC: Report Foxconn’s plans to diversify business were evident early in the year when Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV FCAU announced a potential collaboration in the form of a joint venture.

28,"Mass media company Discovery Communications Inc (NASDAQ: DISCA) is on track to take on Over-the-top (OTT) streaming platforms when it goes live on Monday, reports the New York Times. Discovery’s subscription video on demand (SVOD) services would cost $5 per month with online commercials and $7 per month without the ads. What Happened: According to a Financial Times publication, Discovery’s online streaming services will launch in the U.S. and multiple European nations like Italy and Netherlands beginning Monday.  With the release, Discovery will compete directly with other streaming platforms like Netflix Inc (NASDAQ: NFLX), Apple Inc’s (NASDAQ: AAPL) Apple TV+, or Amazon Inc’s (NASDAQ: AMZN) Prime Video. Discovery’s SVOD will cover various programs from nature shows to cooking shows along with beaming channels like Animal Planet, TLC, and the flagship Discovery Channel. Why Does It Matter: For its success, Discovery Plus is relying on its €1.3 billion deal to broadcast the Tokyo Olympics until 2024 across Europe. The FT post said that broadcasting live sporting events could position Discovery to lead other SVOD platforms. The billion-dollar deal was struck between the mass media company and Discovery’s sports network — Eurosport. Frank Godard, an analyst with Enders Analysis, is skeptical about Discovery’s approach since sporting events are generally spread out over a long period of two or more years. FT quoted him, saying, “The Olympics may be an opportunity to raise the profile of Discovery Plus, but they will need distribution deals with major pay-TV operators and telcos for sustained subscriber growth.” Price Action: DISCA stock closed 0.94% higher at $30.09 on Thursday.

32,"Looking at Q3, Tesla TSLA earned $809.00 million, a 147.4% increase from the preceding quarter. Tesla also posted a total of $8.77 billion in sales, a 45.31% increase since Q2. Tesla earned $327.00 million, and sales totaled $6.04 billion in Q2. Changes in earnings and sales indicate shifts in Tesla’s Return on Capital Employed, a measure of yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed by a business. Generally, a higher ROCE suggests successful growth of a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share in the future. In Q3, Tesla posted an ROCE of 0.05%. It is important to keep in mind ROCE evaluates past performance and is not used as a predictive tool. It is a good measure of a company's recent performance, but several factors could affect earnings and sales in the near future. ROCE is an important metric for the comparison of similar companies. A relatively high ROCE shows Tesla is potentially operating at a higher level of efficiency than other companies in its industry. If the company is generating high profits with its current level of capital, some of that money can be reinvested in more capital which will generally lead to higher returns and earnings per share growth. For Tesla, the return on capital employed ratio shows the number of assets can actually help the company achieve higher returns, an important note investors will take into account when gauging the payoff from long-term financing strategies. Tesla reported Q3 earnings per share at $0.76/share, which beat analyst predictions of $0.56/share. © 2024 Benzinga.com. Benzinga does not provide investment advice. All rights reserved.

33,"Shares of NVIDIA NVDA saw some unusual options activity on Monday. Following the unusual option alert, the stock price moved up to $540.24. Exceptionally large volume (compared to historical averages) is one reason for which options market activity can be considered unusual. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. Open interest is the number of unsettled contracts that have been traded but not yet closed by either counterparty. In other words, open interest represents the quantity of contracts that individual parties have written but not yet found a counterparty for (i.e. a buyer finding a seller, or a seller finding a buyer). Another sign of unusual activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Usually, additional time until a contract expires allows more opportunity for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important to consider because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. Contracts that are “out of the money” are also indicative of unusual options activity. “Out of the money” contracts occur when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made with the expectation that the value of the underlying asset is going to change dramatically in the future, and buyers and sellers will benefit from a greater profit margin. Options are “bullish” when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are “bearish” when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price. These observations are made without knowing the investor’s true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock. Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.

35,"After again setting record deliveries in the fourth quarter of 2020, Tesla Inc TSLA is continuing to look forward and push to manufacture more electric vehicles in 2021.  An SEC filing on Tesla's website, covered by Teslarati, shows that Tesla has signed a new long term agreement with Panasonic Corporation PCRFY for battery cells made in Japan. The agreement spans from Oct. 1, 2020 until March 31, 2022.  No pricing details have been disclosed yet, but Panasonic cells from Japan are known to be used in Tesla's Model S and X, so an update related to those vehicles could be coming soon.

36,"Northern Genesis Acquisition Corp NGA shares are rallying on news the company has a deal with Amazon.com AMZN for electric vehicles and an equity stake. What Happened: Lion Electric is set to go public with SPAC Northern Genesis Acquisition Corp. The company issued an SEC filing last week that showed the company has a deal in place with Amazon. The filing calls for the purchase of up to 2,500 Lion 6 and Lion 8 electric trucks from Lion Electric. Amazon Logistics is listed as the specified customer after being unnamed in previous Northern Genesis filings. Under the terms of the deal, Lion Electric is required to reserve a portion of its manufacturing capacity for up to 500 trucks per year from 2021 to 2025. The deal calls for Lion Electric to provide the greater of 500 trucks per year of 10% of manufacturing capacity from 2026 to 2030. Lion Electric will also provide maintenance and training to Amazon. Related Link: 10 SPAC Picks For Investors To Consider In 2021 Why It’s Important: Lion Electric had previously signed a deal with Amazon for 10 Lion 6 trucks and has delivered two. The SEC filing includes an option for Amazon to purchase common shares of Lion Electric at $5.66 and warrants to purchase shares at $23.36. The full vesting of the warrants requires spending by Amazon of at least $1.1 billion annually. Amazon could own 20% of Lion Electric in the future with its ownership options. As part of the deal, Amazon is not required to purchase a “specified minimum quantity of vehicles from Lion” other than the existing purchase order. Lion Electric said it had 300 purchase orders in hand and identified 6,000 potential vehicle sales at the time of its SPAC merger announcement. The company sees 2021 revenue hitting $204 million from 650 units sold and 2023 revenue hitting $1.67 billion from 7,580 units sold.

40,"Benzinga's PreMarket Prep airs every morning from 8-9 a.m. ET. During that fast-paced, highly informative hour, traders and investors tune in to get the major news of the day, the catalysts behind those moves and the corresponding price action for the upcoming session. On any given day, the show will cover at least 20 stocks determined by co-hosts Joel Elconin and Dennis Dick along with producer Spencer Israel. While the broad market is off to a rocky start in 2021, not all issues are moving in the same direction. One of those issues is Nvidia NVDA and is the PreMarket Prep Stock Of The Day. What A Year In 2020: After ending 2019 at $235.30, the issue followed the S&P 500 index higher and made a new all-time high in mid-February at $316.32. It followed the index lower in late February and into March. It bottomed a few days ahead of the index on March 18 at $180.62 and rallied to end that session at $202.82. That low came in between its October 2019 low ($170.13) and November 2019 low ($198.59). After the down month in March, it embarked on a six-month rally that finally peaked in September at $589.07. It reached that area once again in November, but that rally stalled at $587.66 and it retreated to end the year at $522.20. For the year, it was higher by 122%, far outpacing the index’s return of 16%. Catalyst For The Rally: On days similar to today, the media searches for reasons why the market surrendered its premarket gains or why an issue such as Nvidia is firmly in the green. However, there is not always one specific reason. The simple explanation is that money is always moving around when investors are selling out of one sector, they’re putting it to work in another. It could be as simple as growth to value and vice versa or there could be specific news driving a sector in the session. For example, two of its closest peers in the chip sector are also bucking the trend as Taiwan Semiconductor TSM and Intel INTC are higher by 2.5% and 0.5%, respectively.  Moving Forward: While the rally in the issue is positive in a weak tape, is today’s rally a precursor to the year ahead or simply a rare occurrence where it does not mimic the price action of the S&P 500 index? With its next earnings report not until Feb. 11, it's early for the issue to embark on a pre-earnings rally, which is common in stocks with strong uptrends. Also, with no major rating changes since the day following its last report, it’s doubtful there will be a significant upgrade or downgrade in the issue until after its fourth-quarter report. Well Defined Trading Range: While bulls of the issue want to blast through $600 and bears want it to crash below $500, the truth of the matter is that it’s in a trading range. Since its two-day tumble from its Nov. 9 high ($587.66) to $505.13 on Nov. 10, it has been in a trading range between from $510 to $550. Over that time period, a majority of the price action has taken place just above and below the $530 level, which is where it’s at right now. Perhaps instead of being super bullish or bearish, it may be best to wait until it moves out of this trading range before banking on the direction of its next major move. © 2024 Benzinga.com.

43,"Tesla Inc TSLA nearly met what many thought was an insurmountable 2020 deliveries target in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic — and beat Street projections. What Happened: Tesla delivered 499,550 vehicles in 2020, just shy of CEO Elon Musk's 500,000-unit goal and ahead of the Street estimate of 481,261 vehicles.  The total for 2020 was up from 367,500 in 2019, and topped off a year in which the company's share price rose 743%, according to Bloomberg. The Tesla Analysts:  JPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman maintained an Underweight rating on Tesla shares and increased the price target from $90 to $105. Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives has a Neutral rating on Tesla with a $715 price target. Why Tesla's Performance Doesn't Match Valuation: That fact that Tesla nearly met its guidance at the start of the year and essentially met its modestly revised guidance at the midpoint of the year is certainly impressive in a year that saw global light vehicle production fall 16% in 2020, JPMorgan analyst Brinkman said in a Monday note. The performance is less impressive from the perspective of Tesla's valuation, the analyst said.  The 697% increase in the stock price over the last year is not in proportion to simply meeting delivery guidance, he said. ""Tesla's ability to grow roughly in line with expectations in 2020 is impressive because it suggests greater underlying momentum given the headwinds faced in 2020."" The 2020 performance was impressive, but not as impressive as the stock price appreciation, Brinkman said.  Related Link: Why Tesla Is Unlikely To Buy A Traditional Automaker Outright  Reflecting the higher fourth-quarter deliveries and reports of strong demand for Model Y vehicles in China, suggestive of higher future deliveries, JPMorgan raised its forecast for the company. The firm increased its EPS estimates for 2021 from $2.63 to $3.40 and from $3.47 to $4.50 for 2022. Deliveries for 2021 and 2022 are expected to reach 715,000 and 885,000, respectively, in JPMorgan's view.  Why China Demand Could Be Huge Driver For Tesla:   Delivery beats  by Tesla and its Chinese peers Nio Inc – ADR NIO, Xpeng Inc – ADR XPEV and Li Auto Inc. LI reinforce the view that Chinese demand is robust, Ives said in a note.  The Chinese demand dynamic as evidenced by this weekend's delivery numbers will disproportionately benefit Tesla, the clear EV category leader, over the next few years, the analyst said.  This is especially true in the key China region, which could represent about 40% of Tesla's EV deliveries by 2022, he said.  TSLA Price Action: At last check, Tesla shares were rising by 2.87% to $725.93.  Related Link: Tesla Model Y Deliveries to Start in China This Month Photo courtesy of Tesla. © 2024 Benzinga.com.

Our #1 AI Stock Pick is on a steep discount - 29$ instead of 99$! Click here to access exclusive research! U.S. stock futures rose in the pre-market Monday on optimism driven by the continued government stimulus and the availability of the Covid-19 vaccine. However, the three key indexes in the U.S. fell later in the day. At 12:50 p.m. ET, the S&P 500 fell 2.39 percent, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 2.23 percent, and Nasdaq Composite slipped 2.50 percent. On the other hand, stocks in the European and Asian markets rose on Monday. Europe Stoxx 600 advanced about 1.4 percent, the Shanghai composite rose 0.86 percent, the Shenzhen component climbed 2.466 percent, and KOSPI jumped 2.8 percent. Investors are hopeful that the mass availability of the coronavirus vaccine will help the economic activity to bounce back to the pre-pandemic levels. The confirmed Covid-19 cases around the world exceeded 85 million on Monday, with more than 1.8 million casualties due to the virus, according to the data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. The U.S. is on the top with at least 20.6 million confirmed cases so far, with the death toll hitting 351,590. According to the New York Times tracker, over 201,476 new cases were reported on Sunday, while 1,353 people lost their lives. The United Kingdom today added AstraZeneca’s vaccine to its mass vaccination campaign. U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson recently said the new vaccine will protect millions of people in the coming months. However, he hinted at more restrictions as the second wave of the coronavirus continues to infect a large number of people with every passing day. If we look at the key U.S. stocks, Tesla shares jumped more than 5 percent this morning after the company reported record deliveries for 2020. However, the big tech giants including Facebook (FB), Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Alphabet (GOOGL), slightly moved down this morning.  The dollar index is also down approx. 0.5 percent today. It is trading around its lowest in more than two years. The dollar fell against major currencies including the Chinese Yuan, Japanese yen, and euro. On the other hand, Gold futures were up more than 2 percent on Monday morning, as the dollar slipped to new lows. Chief market strategist at FXTM, Hussein Sayed recently said in a statement that, “Multiple factors are likely to continue lending support for gold in the upcoming months.” Gold has performed well in recent months. It rose about 0.5 percent last week, more than 6 percent during the last month, and about 25 percent over the last year. Meanwhile, Bitcoin (BTC) climbed to new highs on Sunday, touching a record high of $34,792.47. However, the biggest cryptocurrency fell around 10 percent on Monday and is currently trading around $31,000. BTC has shown extreme volatility in recent weeks. Nevertheless, the cryptocurrency climbed about 171 percent in the fourth quarter of 2020, making it one of the top-performing assets for investors. Now we will have a look at the top 10 gainers of this morning. 10. Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares rose more than 3 percent earlier today. The stock has performed well over the last year by rising more than 125 percent. The 52-week range of the stock is $180.68-$589.07.

(NASDAQ:ZM) shares rose more than 5 percent on Monday morning for no apparent reason. The company made exceptional gains in 2020, with its stock value rising nearly 400 percent during the last year. Most of the gains were attributed to the lockdowns during the pandemic, which significantly increased the demand for its video conferencing software.

Moderna Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) Moderna Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA) got off to a good start today, with stock advancing more than 7 percent after the company announced that it is looking forward to producing 100 million doses of its coronavirus vaccine for the U.S. market in Q1. Those would be enough to vaccinate 50 million people, as two shots of the vaccine are needed to vaccinate a single person. MRNA has already supplied 18 million doses of its vaccine in the U.S since getting approval from the FDA last month. 6. Bilibili Inc. (NASDAQ:BILI) Bilibili Inc. (NASDAQ:BILI) stock hit a new 52-week high of $96.18 in the current trading session. BILI is a rapidly growing entertainment company.

46,"One of the best-performing IPOs of 2020 was SaaS company C3.ai Inc AI. The stock priced at $42, above its initial range of $30 to $33, and closed at $161 in their first week of trading.  Growth Ahead: C3.ai is called a disruptive enterprise software vendor by Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives. It's ""the LeBron of AI setting up for massive growth,"" said Ives, who initiated the company with an Outperform rating and $200 price target. C3.ai has a subscription model that could drive 30% revenue growth annually and strong gross margins, said KeyBanc analyst Michael Turits. The analyst has a Sector Weight rating on shares of C3.ai based on valuation. ""AI is the new internet for the enterprises,"" said Piper Sandler analyst Arvind Ramnani, who rates the stock Overweight with a $166 price target. Ramnani said the company's revenue and gross margins are supported by strong gross retention and partnerships that will drive sales. Related Link: IPO Outlook For The Week: Airbnb, DoorDash Lead Highly Anticipated Week Partnerships: The company's partnerships with Microsoft Corporation MSFT and Baker Hughes BKR are a positive for Ives.  Turits mentioned a partnership with Baker Hughes and said it has a minimum value of $450 million for a five-year contract. Raytheon RTX and Adobe ADBE are were also mentioned. ""C3 has established lighthouse go-to-market and development partnerships with leaders in industries like energy (Baker Hughes), defense (Raytheon), financial services (FIS) and horizontal partnerships like CRM (Microsoft/Adobe),"" the analyst said. Analysts On C3.ai's Valuation: Wedbush Ives' price target comes from a valuation of 27x EV/revenue for fiscal year 2026. Turits is cautious on C3.ai shares due to valuation. The analyst said three customers equal 44% of the company's revenue and has a relatively small number of customers. ""Despite its large, dynamic market opportunity, we view AI as fully valued at 82.2x EV/revenue (CY21E),"" he said.  C3.ai is valued at 35x 2023 estimated revenue of $325 million by Ramnani. Morgan Stanley analyst Sanjit Singh initiated shares with an Underweight rating and $100 price target. The analyst said there is ""compelling growth ahead,"" but success is priced in.

48,"The following post was written and/or published as a collaboration between Benzinga’s in-house sponsored content team and a financial partner of Benzinga. TD Ameritrade’s Investor Movement Index (IMX) — a monthly behavior-based index that indicates the attitude of retail investors — rebounded in the month of December, reaching the highest point in almost three years. The IMX increased to 6.26 in December, up 15.71% from its November score of 5.41. The index goes up when clients are net buyers and goes down when clients are net sellers.  During the month of December, clients were net buyers overall and were net buyers of equities. “To cap off a tumultuous year, the positive headlines in December offered an opportunity for TD Ameritrade clients to increase their exposure to the markets,” said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade.  One such headline that increased exposure was the growing optimism among investors that Congress would pass a much-needed second stimulus package. This promising update came after months of prolonged negotiations within the White House. Positive vaccine news also came through as a key FDA advisory panel recommended broad distribution of the first COVID-19 vaccine in the U.S, which resulted in the FDA granting emergency authorization to two vaccines. TD Ameritrade clients bought some familiar names during the month of December. Some of these stocks included Pfizer Inc. PFE, Moderna Inc MRNA, NIO Inc NIO, Tesla Inc TSLA, and salesforce.com, inc. CRM. And while clients were net buyers of equities overall, some popular company names that clients sold during the period were Slack Technologies Inc WORK, Fastly Inc FSLY, Occidental Petroleum Corporation OXY, Haliburton Company HAL, and Twitter Inc TWTR. ""There’s no question that the final trading period of the year reflected a growing sense of optimism around economic recovery and hope for an end to the pandemic. In 2021, however, the pandemic will most likely continue as the No. 1 news story for at least the first half of the year and with that, it will most likely remain the greatest source of market volatility,” said Kinahan.

50,"In 2020, the technology sector was hot, but many cloud computing equities were simply scintillating, a theme that's still in its early innings. What Happened: For investors that like the idea of cloud exposure, but don't like the idea of stock picking in this segment, there are three dedicated exchange traded funds to consider, all of which delivered impressive 2020 performances. To put those showings into context, the worst-performing cloud ETF gained almost 58%, but in a case of differences between ETFs that appear similar proving meaningful, the WisdomTree Cloud Computing Fund WCLCD gained almost 110% last year. That's good for one of the best returns among all non-leveraged ETFs, thematic or otherwise. Why It's Important: WCLD, which debuted in September 2019, tracks the BVP Nasdaq Emerging Cloud Index. The “BVP” stands for Bessemer Venture Partners, a firm with expertise in cloud investing and public cloud benchmarks. “Technology is increasingly driving global GDP and software is the fastest growing segment of technology,” write Byron Deeter and Mary D’Onofrio of Bessemer. “Within software, the growth of cloud is moving at an impressive clip; it’s becoming abundantly clear that cloud computing will become a majority of enterprise software by 2025, and the vast majority of all software by 2030. Simply put, cloud computing is increasingly consuming software, hardware, and services and is therefore the most exciting mega-trend in technology, making it one of the most compelling themes impacting global GDP over the coming years.” As WisdomTree points out, Bessemer coined a new investing acronym, one that could rival or supplant FAANG: MT SAAS. That's for Microsoft MSFT, Twilio TWLO, Salesforce CRM, Amazon AMZN, Adobe ADBE and Shopify SHOP. In alphabetical order, Adobe, the Dow component Salesforce, Shopify and Twilio are members of the WCLD roster. What's Next: The inclusion of those names in WCLD is relevant for myriad reasons, including revenue growth. To enter WCLD's index, new components must have revenue growth of 15% in each of the prior two fiscal years and to stay in the benchmark, a company must have a minimum of 7% top line growth in one of the past two years. And no, lacking Amazon and Microsoft exposure doesn't harm WCLD's long-term prospects. “MT SAAS is a mix of application (CRM, ADBE, SHOP) and infrastructure (MSFT, TWLO, AMZN) companies, incumbent giants (MSFT, AMZN) and hypergrowth challengers (CRM, ADBE, SHOP, TWLO), all sharing the same characteristics of cloud delivery models, cloud business models, high growth, and compelling long-term margin potential,” notes Bessemer. © 2024 Benzinga.com.

53,"Twitter Inc TWTR has acquired the social podcast app Breaker, the latter's CEO Erik Berlin said in a statement on Monday. What Happened: Berlin, along with and the company’s Chief Technological Officer Leah Culver are “looking forward to helping create new experiences for the Twitter community.” Breaker will shut down its services for users on Jan. 15  and suggests users migrate their subscriptions to another podcast listening app like Spotify Technology SA SPOT or Apple Inc.'s AAPL Apple Music by exporting an OPML file. Why It Matters: The app is known for giving a social dimension to podcasts by allowing users to comment on episodes and by fostering engagement among listeners, reported TechCrunch. Culver, who is also the co-founder of Breaker, said on Twitter she would “help build” Spaces, which is the Jack Dorsey-led social network’s voice-based social networking product.

According to a Reddit user, the furniture company has even imprinted a dig at Sony on the side of its fake PS5 which reads, “Which Ikea media storage unit will be able to fit my new, meme-ishly oversized, gaming console?” Why It Matters: The dummy consoles can be useful for the lucky few who have managed to get their hands on the rare gaming devices as they allow shoppers to correctly gauge the dimensions of a new entertainment center, the Verge noted.  See Also: PlayStation 5, Xbox Units Unexpectedly Arrived At GameStop Stores.

57,"Tesla Inc TSLA is expected to begin taking orders from customers in Israel in a matter of days, according to local media reports. What Happened: The Elon Musk-led company has obtained a license that allows it to begin full import operations with no cap on volumes, Israel’s Globes newspaper reported Monday — citing people familiar with the matter.  Tesla is looking at sites for its charging stations and the requisite formalities for setting up the necessary infrastructure in the Middle Eastern country.  The Palo Alto, California-based automaker will initially market its Model 3 vehicle in Israel, which is expected to be priced at NIS 250,000 - NIS 350,000 ($77,908 - $109,071) depending on the version, as per local media. Why It Matters: Previously, Tesla operated in Israel as a “small importer,” which meant it could only import up to 20 vehicles — mainly for testing purposes, as per Globes. Tesla is reportedly the first automaker to have obtained a license in the country for direct importing and marketing of vehicles, without partnering with a local dealer. Last week, India’s transport minister said Tesla would mark its entry into the country this year where its entry-level sedan would likely be priced at $74,559.

60,"In what could be a leading indicator for Apple Inc's AAPL performance in the holiday quarter, its Taiwanese contract manufacturer Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd.-ADR HNHPF reported strong results for the three months ended December 2020. What Happened:  Revenue for December came in at 713.8 billion New Taiwanese dollars ($25.52 billion), representing a 4.76% month-over-month increase and a steeper 32.2% year-over-year jump, Hon Hai said in a filing with the Taiwanese stock exchange. For the three months ending in December, revenues were at 2 trillion New Taiwanese dollars ($71 billion), based on monthly revenues reported for October and November. This marked a 55.6% quarter-over-quarter increase and 15.5% year-over-year growth. The quarterly revenues exceed the average estimate of 1.8 trillion New Taiwanese dollars, according to Bloomberg.

61,"BEIJING, CHINA - SEPTEMBER 26: A company logo hangs at the Tesla stand during 2020 Beijing ... [+] International Automotive Exhibition (Auto China 2020) at China International Exhibition Center on September 26, 2020 in Beijing, China. (Photo by VCG/VCG via Getty Images) Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) had a remarkable 2020, as its stock price soared by almost 8x, from levels of around $90 at the beginning of the year to over $700 currently. Although a good deal of the run-up was due to technical factors such as greater retail investor interest in the stock, the inclusion to the S&P 500 index, and a general pivot to higher-growth stocks through the Covid-19 recession, there were some meaningful fundamental developments that helped Tesla over the last year. Below, we take a look at five key developments that helped bolster the Tesla story last year. Tesla Enters Fast-Growing Compact SUV Market Tesla launched the Model Y compact SUV in early 2020 catering to one of the fastest-growing segments in the auto industry. While production is still ramping up, with sales thus far largely limited to the U.S., CEO Elon Musk expects the SUV to eventually be its largest selling model, outselling the Model 3, Model X, and Model S combined. Sales of the vehicles could see a nice bump in 2021, as production begins in Tesla’s Chinese factory. Soaring Regulatory Credit Sales Emission credit sales (up 2.5x year-over-year to about $1.2 billion over the first nine months of 2020) were a big driver of Tesla’s profitability over the last year. These sales, which are almost pure profit, were largely responsible for Automotive Gross margins rising to 26.4% year-to-date, from 20.6% last year. Although these Revenues aren’t likely sustainable in the long-run, they are serving as a fillip to drive profitability as it brings down costs and scales production. Moreover, the policy goals for clean energy of the incoming Biden administration could also bode well for Tesla and its regulatory credit business in the coming years. (related: How Regulatory Credits Impact Tesla’s Margins) Cashing In On China Tesla started production at its Shanghai facility towards the end of 2019, with the capacity to produce about 200k Model 3 vehicles per year. The production startup was well-timed, as automotive demand in China rebounded swiftly as the country was quick to control Covid-19, and Tesla’s cheaper, locally manufactured vehicles, which also benefit from subsidies resonated well with Chinese customers. Tesla Revenues from China grew 90% over the first 9 months of 2020. Tesla’s quick execution on the plant (production began less than a year after it broke ground) also served as an example that it can execute very quickly under the right circumstances, boding well for the company’s upcoming facilities in Germany and Texas. Improving Software Capabilities Tesla is clearly getting more confident about its self-driving software capabilities. The company increased pricing for its full self-driving software upgrade from $7,000 to $8,000 in July and again bumped it up to $10,000 in October. Tesla is well ahead of rivals in the self-driving race. As of April 2020, the company said that its vehicles had driven a total of about 3 billion autonomous miles, compared to Google’s
GOOG
 Waymo which has driven just about 20 million miles. (Just How Far Ahead Is Tesla In The Self-Driving Race?) Tesla intends to offer self-driving software subscriptions for 2021, a revenue model much sought after by technology investors, given the stable, recurring cash flows that it brings in. Battery Advancements Batteries are a big cost driver of electric vehicles (about 15% of the average price of a Tesla vehicle, per our estimates), and reducing battery costs and improving performance could help Tesla boost its margins. (related: How Tesla’s Battery Costs Impact Its Gross Margins) During its first battery day event conducted in September, Tesla announced several enhancements, including the way batteries are designed, manufactured, and integrated into its vehicles, noting that it could eventually reduce costs by 56% per kilowatt-hour. The company also outlined plans to produce its own batteries and even mine its own lithium. Trefis What if you’re looking for a more balanced portfolio instead?

65,"E-commerce giant Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN is revving up the logistics unit that's central to its core business. What Happened:  Amazon announced Tuesday the purchase of 11 Boeing 767-300 aircrafts, including seven from Delta Air Lines, Inc. DAL and four from Canadian airliner WestJet. These new aircraft will join Amazon Air, the company's  cargo airline,  by 2022. Related Link: Will Amazon Stock Reach $4,000 By 2022?  Why It's Important:  The fleet expansion comes at a time when customers are increasingly favoring fast, free shipping, Amazon said. ""Our goal is to continue delivering for customers across the U.S. in the way that they expect from Amazon, and purchasing our own aircraft is a natural next step toward that goal,"" Sarah Rhoads, vice president of Amazon Global Air, said in a statement.  ""Having a mix of both leased and owned aircraft in our growing fleet allows us to better manage our operations, which in turn helps us to keep pace in meeting our customer promises."" Amazon Air was launched by the company in 2016. The four aircraft purchased from WestJet in March 2020 are currently undergoing passenger to cargo conversion and will join Amazon Air's network in 2021, while the seven aircraft from Delta will enter Amazon's air cargo network in 2022. The company said it will rely on third-party carriers to operate these new aircraft. At last check, Amazon shares were rising 0.19% to $3,192.66.

67,"Tesla Inc's TSLA Model S and Model X have long had a feature called bioweapon defense mode. When enabled, the car creates positive pressure on the inside, so air can't come in through any cracks in the doors, and brings all air into the car through a HEPA filter. This allows the occupants to breathe clean air no matter what the surroundings provide. Up until now, this mode wasn't available on the lower-cost Model 3 and Model Y. CEO Elon Musk had said the Model 3 didn't have room for a big enough filter. But now some pictures posted by Tesmanian show the made in China Model Y will come with the bioweapon defense mode. Pictures show the feature enabled on the car, describing the filter being as big as the one on the Model X. Benzinga's Take: While anyone would appreciate this feature, the Chinese market may appreciate it the most with citizens often having concerns over air quality. During the California wildfires, owners praised the bioweapon defense mode, saying it saved them from the smoke. In high pollution areas, this option could potentially be a literal lifesaver.

68,"The video game industry saw major developments in 2020 with the release of new consoles from Microsoft Corporation MSFT and Sony Corporation SNE. The sector also got attention as a winner due to the number of people who were at home during the pandemic. Here’s a look at what could be ahead in 2021 for video game stocks. Sony Corporation: The PlayStation 5 had strong sales in 2020 and was the winner in the console wars battle. The story for 2021 for Sony could be the company’s exclusive titles, which could be among the reasons it won in 2020. The company has “Returnal,” “Gran Turismo 7” and ”Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart” as console exclusives. Sony is also expected to release “God of War: Ragnarok” in 2021, which has been listed as one of the most anticipated games of 2021. Related Link: GameStop Reports Mixed Q3 Earnings, More Store Closures Microsoft: While Microsoft didn’t win the 2020 console war battle, it did make a large gaming-related acquisition with its purchase of ZeniMax Media. The deal gives Microsoft control of hit franchises like “Dishonored,” “Fallout,” “Doom” and “The Elder Scrolls.” The studio will release a new first-person shooter with “Deathloop,” which is ironically a Playstation 5 exclusive timed release. Microsoft will also release “Halo Infinite” in fall 2021, a highly anticipated exclusive game that was initially supposed to release with the Xbox Series X.  Activision Blizzard: Video game publisher Activision Blizzard ATVI is rumored to release “Overwatch 2,” the highly anticipated sequel to the game released five years ago that is now a popular esports league. The sequel could increase interest in the name going forward. The Blizzard unit could also have a huge 2021 with the potential release of “Diablo 4” for PC and “Diablo Immortal” for mobile. Blizzard’s latest release in the “World of Warcraft” series posted record-breaking numbers in 2020. Nintendo: Despite the new consoles from Sony and Microsoft, Nintendo Co NTDOY outperformed both stocks with a 60% gain versus 40% gains from the other two. The company topped the leaderboards for years with its Switch console before the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. The Switch could continue to outperform in 2021 with exclusive titles coming like “Monster Hunter Rise,” “Pokemon Snap” and the potential sequel to “The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.” Immersion: With the PlayStation 5 selling well, one of the potential winners for 2021 could be Immersion Corporation IMMR, the company providing the haptic technology for the DualSense controllers. Several games coming in 2021 like “Returnal” and “Deathloop” are designed to take advantage of the haptic feedback in the controllers.  Amazon: A wild card to watch in the gaming sector for 2021 is Amazon.com AMZN. The company owns Twitch, a leader in video game streaming in the U.S. The story in 2021 could be the release of “New World” in the spring. The MMORPG from Amazon was one of three games announced back in 2016 and the only one to make it to the release stage. The success and reception of the game could influence how big of a focus Amazon puts on video games in the future. © 2024 Benzinga.com. Benzinga does not provide investment advice.

70,"We have several FREE e-letters that could help you out.
Just take this short survey to see which one is best for you. By jhill Updated Feb 8, 2022 at 3:33PM
 Electric vehicles are gaining momentum. Tesla gets most of the headlines, but there are many other EV stocks as well. The industry has some unique investing opportunities. That’s why I’ve put together this list of six stocks to watch. Before investing in any of these EV companies, it’s also important to look at larger auto industry trends. For example, many governments are pushing EV adoption higher. Advancing technology is also making them more affordable. To get some insight on that end, stick around after the company highlights below… This list of EV stocks gives you a good mix of electric car companies to invest in. Some are pure plays and others have less direct business models. They also span multiple continents and countries. Let’s take a closer look at what makes some of these EV companies unique…  NIO is a Chinese EV company that’s a true Tesla competitor. It specializes in the design and development of electric vehicles. In November 2020, NIO delivered 5,291 vehicles, and that’s up 109% from last year. One important area NIO has made strides in is battery technology. This has helped it ramp up its battery-as-a-service offerings and battery-swapping initiatives. According to William Bin Li, the founder and CEO… As of today, NIO has deployed 143 battery swap stations across 64 cities in China and completed over 800,000 battery swaps for our users. NIO is continuing to improve and expand its network and services. This should help the company remain competitive and increase sales. This also makes it one of the best EV stocks to consider. Nikola has lost some luster but might not be down for the count. In September 2020, Hindenburg Research reported that it believed Nikola was committing fraud. This and some other fumbles led to GM trimming its partnership with Nikola. Since that report, Nikola’s stock has dropped more than 50%, and it led to the resignation of the founder and CEO, Trevor Milton. There are definitely some flags to watch out for, but this EV stock still might have the potential to push ahead. Nikola has released an updated road map to production in 2023. Nikola has also recently entered into an agreement with an Arizona-based utility company and has other deals in the works. Blink Charging is helping to support EV adoption by offering charging stations. Compared with traditional gas stations, there are few EV stations around. So this is a great opportunity as more people make the switch. Blink Charging already has thousands of EV chargers deployed across the United States. You can find them near airports, hotels, healthcare facilities and many other destinations. Blink Charging offers a wide range of business models for host locations. This company is what we consider a “picks and shovels” play. It’s not a direct EV stock, but it’s helping to build a network around them. It’s similar to how businesses that provided picks and shovels during the gold rush profited. It’s indirect but can be quite lucrative. Rivian is the newest of these EV stocks to trade publicly. It’s one of the first companies to market with an electric truck. To learn more about this unique business, check out this article on Rivian IPO. Government regulation is an important piece of EV manufacturing and sales. Nations and states are helping push adoption and innovation higher. They’re doing this with a wide range of incentives, such as tax credits. According to the IEA, global government EV incentives climbed from $5 billion in 2015 to $15 billion in 2018. And it’s likely climbed higher since. Although there’s policy uncertainty which makes it challenging for consumers and EV companies. For example, the U.S. offers up to $7,500 in tax credits for people who buy an electric plug-in vehicle. Although each automaker can sell only up to 200,000 units until this incentive starts to wind down. Tesla and GM have already hit those limits… but that might be increased with other EV-friendly policies on the horizon. One of the leading states with EV incentives is California. You can claim up to $9,500 to buy new or used. These policies are changing over time but continue to drive demand higher. This bodes well for EV stocks and check out these charging station stocks as well. The auto industry is seeing big disruption and it’s creating some great investing opportunities. Although, it’s only a small corner of the market. There are many new investing opportunities to consider today. June 26, 2024  June 1, 2024  April 22, 2024  April 10, 2024 "

After the launch of its  5G-ready iPhone series  in 2020 and a host of other products and services, more could roll out of the tech giant's stable in the new year. iPhone 13 Arrival?  Apple could launch four devices in 2021, including two high-end Pro models, while the remaining two will be positioned as budget models, according to Macrumors. It is also believed Apple may name it as iPhone 12S. AirTags See Light of Day:  Apple's long-rumored AirTags are on track for a launch in 2021, Macrumors reported, citing analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. AirTags are meant to keep track of one's personal belongings such as keys and wallets. Apple users will receive notifications on their Apple devices when the items tagged to AirTags are separated from them. AirTags will be managed through a new Items tab in the Find My iPhone app, MacRumors said. ""We think 2021 is the year. AirTags would compete directly with Tile and have the obvious advantage of being integrated within Apple's Find My software, iCloud services, and hardware ecosystem,"" Loup Ventures analyst Gene Munster said. Related Link:  What iPhone Supplier Foxconn's Strong Quarterly Revenue Means For Apple  AR Device In The Offing? Apple, which is speculated to be working on an augmented reality headset, glasses or both, is expected to launch an AR device, Kuo reportedly said.

AirPods, Apple Silicon Macs, Mini-LED Display Devices:  Apple is also likely to launch new AirPods, Apple's wireless Bluetooth earbuds; more Apple Silicon Macs; and its first devices with mini-LED displays, the report said, citing Kuo. Specifically, the analyst expects a new 12.9-inch iPad Pro and redesigned 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with Apple chips. Podcast Bundling Service:  Apple could bundle premium podcasts, with Apple Music and  Apple One  at no extra charge for paying subscribers, Munster said.

76,"Apple Inc AAPL informed the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in a proxy filing on Tuesday that, starting 2021, it will modify cash incentive for executives to incorporate “Apple values” and community initiatives. What Happened: Apple said that the values span environmental, social, and governance fields and the change has been made to “further motivate Apple’s executive team to meet exceptionally high standards of values-driven leadership in addition to delivering strong financial results.” No changes are planned on the level of rewards or the threshold of performance requirements and goals, as per the Tim Cook-led company. Apple said that its compensation committee will use the modifier to establish an increase or decrease in bonus payments by up to 10% based on the performance of executives with respect to Apple’s values and key community initiatives during the year. Why It Matters: The consumer electronics giant pointed to the new modifier while recommending to vote against a shareholder proposal to reduce executive pay to the median employee pay at Apple, reported Reuters. See Also: Apple Plans To Go Carbon Neutral Across Supply Chain, Products Within A Decade Cook’s 2021 compensation will include a long-term equity award, for the first time since he was promoted to the chief executive’s post. “This award will better align the structure of his time-based and performance-based equity incentives with the awards of our other named executive officers,” the company said. Cook’s 2020 salary of $14.8 million is 256 times greater than the median Apple pay of $57,783, noted Reuters. In September, Cook was given his first-ever stock grant, worth over $114 million.

79,"Oxbotica, a United Kingdom-based developer of autonomous vehicle software, has raised $47 million in a Series B funding round, Reuters reports. The self-driving tech company intends to focus on industrial applications. What Happened: Oxbotica is an Oxford University spin-out, developing autonomous driving technologies. The company calls it “universal autonomy — ” a flexible technology that can power the navigation, perception, user interfaces, fleet management, and other features needed to run self-driving vehicles, as per TechCrunch. Oxbotica claims that its self-driving technology can be used irrespective of the vehicle type. Reuters notes that autonomous technology for freight trucks on highways has garnered investor attention as it is easier and cheaper to roll out than motorway driving. Why It Matters: Oxbotica CEO Ozgur Tohumcu said in an interview that autonomous technology use is needed most in mines or ports. “We see a huge transformation happening in the industrial domain,” Tohumcu said, as per TechCrunch. Co-founder and Chief Technology Officer Paul Newman said Oxbotica stands out from other software providers because it’s lighter and easier to use. The funding was led by the venture arm of BP plc BP BP Ventures, Halma plc HLMAF, and Tencent Holdings TCEHY. A Bloomberg report in May called Alphabet Inc’s GOOG GOOGL autonomous driving unit Waymo “the one to beat.” Tesla Inc TSLA CEO Elon Musk said last month that its full self-driving (FSD) software is set to become “absurdly good.” Image Courtesy: Wikimedia © 2024 Benzinga.com.

Reportedly, the details surrounding the fundraiser haven't yet been finalized. What Happened: Rivian's current investors include industry bigwigs like the auto company Ford Motor Company F, the tech giant Amazon Inc AMZN, and investment management firms like T. Rowe Price Group TROW, and BlackRock Inc BLK. A Rivian representative told Bloomberg that the automaker is presently focused on achieving its delivery targets for R1T, R1S, and Amazon’s delivery vehicles in 2021.

81,"Bond yields and interest rates are expected to remain at a historical low for a while, and the next best way for investors to find income is the stock market, CNBC ""Mad Money"" host Jim Cramer said Tuesday.  “With my diversified dividend portfolio, you can get a 5% plus yield with the possibility of actual upside,” Cramer said. According to the former hedge fund manager, it’s still possible to get an income with a degree of safety in the current environment. Cramer warned that investors should not chase high yielding stocks as more than 8% dividend yield resembles a red flag. “It tells you that there’s a lot of risk, and if you’re investing for income, risk is the last thing you want,” he added. Dividends are like rewards that companies pay for holding a stock. Fast-growing companies like Amazon.com AMZN and Tesla Inc TSLA invest full profits back into the business for growth and expansion in lieu of a dividend payment, Cramer noted. He put together a diversified portfolio of nine high-yielding dividend stocks that have a strong balance sheet. Dow Inc DOW: It yields 5.02%. Cramer thinks the stock is a good performer and is likely to go higher due to polyethylene’s rising price. See What Analysts Think about Dow IBM IBM: It yields 5.17%. Though Cramer called IBM a controversial pick, he thinks that IBM’s Red Hat acquisition was smart, and the company is focusing on fast-growing future opportunities. IBM also named former Trump advisor Gary Cohn as vice-chairman recently. AbbVie Inc ABBV: It yields 4.88%. The company has a great pipeline of drugs and two blockbuster drugs that are “growing like crazy,” as per Cramer. B&G Foods, Inc. BGS: It yields 7.11%. The company has a steady cash flow. According to Cramer, with more people cooking during the lockdown, B&G brand foods are perfect for consumers. Chevron Corporation CVX: It yields 5.93%. They have a strong balance sheet and Cramer thinks the company will do well under the Biden administration as it will be difficult to acquire new wells, making the existing ones more valuable. Verizon Communications Inc. VZ: It yields 4.28%. Cramer called it a slow and steady grower. In the utility stocks group, Cramer recommended American Electric Power Company Inc AEP with 3.64% yield, Dominion Energy Inc D with 3.45% yield, and Entergy Corporation ETR with 3.93% yield. © 2024 Benzinga.com.

See Also: Tesla, Volkswagen, Renault See Strong Share In Europe: Over 1 Million EVs Sold In 11 Months Tesla was the market leader in Norway in 2019. Why It Matters: The market share of electric cars in Norway has risen to 54% in 2020 from 42% in the preceding year, noted CNN. Norway is reportedly the world leader in EV adoption with EVs accounting for two-thirds of all sales during December. In December, Chinese EV firm Xpeng Inc XPEV marked its Norwegian foray pitting itself against Volkswagen, Tesla, and Ford Motor Company F. Norway and Canada are next in line after the United States to receive Tesla’s full-self driving beta software, according to Musk.  Price Action: Tesla shares traded nearly 2.4% higher at $752.90 on Monday in the after-hours session after closing almost 0.7% higher at $735.11. On the same day, Volkswagen OTC shares closed 1.28% higher at $20.56.

83,"Apple Inc AAPL has secured patents related to two-way wireless charging, which could potentially mean the MacBook range of computers could be used in the future to charge other Apple devices, the Verge reported Tuesday. What Happened: The patents, first noted by Patently Apple, describe how inductive coils could be placed under the chassis of a MacBook that could allow for charging an Apple Watch, iPhone, or the AirPods charging case. Multiple devices can reportedly be charged as per the patents using the computer’s palm rest, trackpad, or lid. Why It Matters: The patented technology could help users travel without power adapters for multiple devices, which according to the Tim Cook-led company can be “burdensome,” noted the Verge. The Cupertino, California-based company stopped including power bricks with its latest range of 5G iPhones. In November, Apple revealed a MagSafe Duo Adapter, which costs $180, and is capable of charging two devices at a time. At present, MacBook pros are made out of Aluminium, which is not compatible with wireless charging, according to the Verge.

			The pullback presents opportunities		 The market sold off on the first day of the new trading year as investors worried about the continued impact of a resurging COVID-19 infection rate and a very bumpy rollout of the vaccine. Those worries seem reasonable, given the slight decrease in private payrolls. As CNBC reports:
 Private payrolls in December contracted for the first time since the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, according to a report Wednesday from ADP. The decrease of 123,000 provided a sign that the U.S. economy had cooled considerably heading into the end of 2020. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been expecting growth of 60,000. However, there is still good news in the market. Traders seemed pleased with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and several non-member countries (collectively known as OPEC+) decision to keep production levels relatively even. The back and forth we have seen so far is basically what we would expect. Investors shouldn’t draw too many conclusions about the market until we have a few more trading sessions under our belt and volatility has calmed down. Although they can be annoying, higher volatility levels keep option premiums elevated and mean we can find some good bullish trades at support. Today we are eyeing Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) as a target for short puts, but we want to make sure they expire before earnings later this month. If you recall, last week U.S. government agencies were hacked through a vulnerability in systems operated by a company calls SolarWinds (NYSE:SWI). The hack has been investigated and it has many root causes, but it didn’t just affect government agencies. Microsoft was targeted. As Zacks reported: Microsoft Corporation MSFT in a blog post revealed that its ongoing investigation related to the SolarWinds SWI cyberattack detected that hackers were able to view some of its internal source code. The company stated that it detected “unusual activity” for a few of its internal accounts and found out that one of those accounts has been employed to view source code in several repositories. This bad news could have contributed to Microsoft’s pullback, but how big of a risk is this for investors? As Investopedia writes: The full impact of the SolarWinds breach, which Microsoft refers to as “Solorigate,” remains an unfolding story, including its effect on Microsoft and the company’s customers. A cause for optimism is the fact that Microsoft is taking this issue very seriously, continues to investigate, and apparently is willing to be open about the effects on its own business. In other words, people will just have to trust Microsoft to properly deal with the issue. As a company with vast resources, it is likely going to be able to weather the storm. And as an investment opportunity, it still has growth on its side. Growth in Microsoft’s Azure cloud products is still a blistering 47% on a year-over-year basis. And we can’t stress enough the nearly unique fact that MSFT reported its overall revenue grew by 13% and 12% in the second and third quarter 2020 on an annualized basis. In our view, Microsoft’s growth in cloud computing, subscription software, and collaboration technology places it in the strongest possible position regardless of whether this data breach creates temporary fear in the market. We had been holding shares of Microsoft, which we initially purchased for $215 each, until last week. Our covered call expired, and our shares were called away for $220 each, meaning we made a profit. Since then, the stock has pulled back to support at around $215.  Whether that is because of the hack or because of the general action in the market, we can’t say for sure – it is likely a combination of the two. What we can say is that $215 would make an excellent strike price for a put write. And since Microsoft reports earnings on Jan. 27, we know we’ll need to set our expiration before then to avoid any earnings-related fluctuations. When picking your expiration, look for a date that provides decent premium, without obligating you for too long.

89,"Investors woke up to an unfamiliar sight Wednesday: The 10-year Treasury yield is back above 1% for the first time since last March. Yields rocketed higher while stocks looked mixed as Democrats took one Georgia Senate seat and led narrowly in the other Georgia Senate race with thousands of votes left to count. Strength in yields could reflect ideas that if Democrats do gain ground, another fiscal stimulus and increased Washington spending could grow more likely. All this is speculation, and no one should be thinking that anything—including the makeup of the Senate as well as new policy priorities—is a done deal. We’ll know at some point who won, so let’s focus on what’s happening right now. There’s the 10-month high in 10-year yields, obviously, and crude hit an 11-month high above $50 a barrel. That happened after Saudi Arabia surprised everyone with a voluntary one million barrel-per-day production cut, according to media reports. The jump in yields appeared to strengthen Financial shares including Bank of America Corp BAC and JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPM.   Back at home, the Nasdaq 100 (NDX) is taking it on the chin as some of the big stocks there like Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, Microsoft Corporation MSFT and Apple Inc AAPL come under pressure in premarket trading. Why? Well, if it’s a 50-50 Senate (with a Democratic tie-breaker), there’s concern about more regulation on the Tech sector. At the same time, Financial stocks and the Russell 2000 Index (RUT) of small-caps are up early on. These parts of the market could get a shot in the arm from higher rates and stimulus hopes if Democrats do extend their lead. Banks benefit from higher rates because it tends to help their profit margins, while the RUT is more exposed to the domestic economy than other indices and also has a big population of regional bank stocks. More government spending (if there’s another stimulus) would likely help keep yields elevated. In the world of individual stocks, some that might benefit from Democratic control include solar energy companies and electric cars. Tesla Inc TSLA shares climbed in pre-market trading, and so did shares of a bunch of solar firms.  You could make a bullish case for either side winning. The bullish case for Democrats is more short-term (the chance for more stimulus), but a Republican victory might be longer-term bullish if it leads to more Washington spending discipline. Trading could be choppy today as investors watch the votes roll in. It’s kind of interesting, though, to see the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) a little lower this morning after it flirted with 30 earlier this week. Keep an eye on that if a final call gets made in Georgia. After starting the year with a selloff, the market turned things around Tuesday thanks in part to leadership from the small-cap RUT and so-called “value” sectors like Energy and Financials. The RUT outpaced every other major index, gaining nearly 2% after a 2020 that saw it recover from early weakness to have a better year than the large-cap S&P 500 Index (SPX). A selloff in bonds yesterday might have gotten the party started both for Financials and the RUT (which has a large contingent of regional banks among its leading stocks). The market wavered and drifted up until early afternoon, and then saw a buying wave come in that lifted almost all the sectors. Some decent data might have helped too, especially ISM manufacturing (see more below). The election was on investors’ minds, and it’s interesting to see how small-caps—which tend to be more sensitive to domestic fiscal policy—rallied Tuesday as voting took place. Beyond the election and yesterday’s rally, this week is packed with data and even a few earnings reports. Tomorrow, investors are expecting to hear from Bed, Bath & Beyond Inc. BBBY, Micron Technology, Inc. MU, Conagra Brands Inc CAG, and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc WBA. All three of these firms have direct consumer exposure. Don’t know what CAG sells? Think about a bunch of stuff that might be in your pantry, including Slim Jims, Duncan Hines, Hunts’, and Vlasic. Yep, tomorrow we’ll get a better sense of how meat sticks, canned tomatoes, pickles, and cake mixes performed in CAG’s most recent quarter, and this is one of those rare companies whose stock has pretty much flatlined over the last year. That can’t be said for WBA, one of the worst performers of 2020 and a prominent one because it’s listed in the Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI). It was the second-worst performer in the $DJI last year after finishing last in 2019. The company’s been hurt by more people getting prescriptions delivered by mail, which means fewer people coming in and browsing at stores. Some analysts think the stock has gotten oversold and may be able to top Wall Street’s estimates. We shall see. Data-wise, the week kicked off with a really nice read on December ISM Manufacturing, which came in well above analysts’ expectations Tuesday at 60.7%. That topped November’s 57.5%, and was way above Wall Street’s average estimate of 56.4%. Believe it or not, the headline figure is now just 10 basis points below the recent high of 60.8% recorded in 2018, Briefing.com pointed out. Anything above 50% shows expansion, and manufacturing data often points toward future demand from businesses and consumers. This looks like a green shoot after some disappointing data over the last few weeks. The big number this week is nonfarm payrolls—arguably the most closely-watched number each month—due out ahead of the bell Friday. See below for more insight into what that important report might show. Something else to watch could be this new strain of virus reported recently in South Africa. It’s still early, but some scientists are worried about how it will respond to vaccines. Just keep in mind that if scientists do determine it’s less responsive, that could make for some ugliness in the markets. Obviously there’s no reason to panic, but just another uncertainty to factor into your thinking.  CHART OF THE DAY: CRUDE SPUTTERING AT $50. Will there be enough momentum to push crude oil futures (/CL—candlestick) above $50 (yellow horizontal line) per barrel? If there is, there is potential for further upside movement perhaps to the high of $54.66, the high reached in February 2020. If /CL doesn’t break above $50, it could fall back within its $47–$48 trading range. Data source: CME Group. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Thanks for the Raise: The new year brings higher pay for many, as 20 states raised their minimum wages on Jan. 1. The debate has raged for decades and probably will continue about whether doing this helps or hurts workers, businesses, and the economy. Also, with the pandemic raging and numerous shutdowns, it’s going to be hard to see an immediate impact. Some might argue that it could present an additional burden on small businesses, for that matter. Still, if vaccinations get things back on a more normal footing and local shops and restaurants see some recovery, rising wages could put extra dollars in employees’ pockets, helping consumer demand down the road. The biggest minimum wage increase is in New Mexico, where it goes from $9 to $10.50. The corollary to this is high levels of consumer debt after the holiday season, which has some economists worried. If consumers are looking at empty pocketbooks as they try to pay their holiday bills, spending levels could get muted in coming weeks.  Watch Your Wallet: Investors expecting an economic recovery often turn to the Consumer Discretionary sector, hoping shoppers will feel more spending power. Since last June—with data generally improving from the virus-related lows—Consumer Discretionary improved too. It rose almost 26%, beating all but two other S&P 500 sectors over that time frame. Things might not be so cut and dried these days, however, and investors should realize Consumer Discretionary is a different sector than it once was. It’s now dominated by a few big stocks and their ups and downs, Barron’s pointed out in a recent arctic.  The most obvious of these are Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, Home Depot Inc HD, and Tesla Inc TSLA, with AMZN and HD both up significantly in 2020 due in part to the “stay at home” market and TSLA going parabolic as it got added the S&P 500. These three stocks—all of which thrived amid virus-related shutdowns—now represent 54% of Consumer Discretionary by market capitalization. That means buying into Consumer Discretionary now and hoping to ride on a recovering consumer is actually “more of a lockdown play” than an investor might expect, Barron’s noted.  Gloomy Expectations for Jobs Report: After rebounding quickly from pandemic lows last spring, job growth has been on the downturn over the past few months and analysts expect that to continue in Friday’s December payrolls report. The average Wall Street estimate is for job creation of just 112,000, down from 245,000 in November and easily the worst figure since last April when the economy was hemorrhaging positions. This weakness could be driven partly by the new wave of virus-related shutdowns that hit the economy in November and continued as winter began, along with signs that companies might be waiting to see how the virus rollout goes before committing to major new hiring. The weak November payrolls report arguably helped lead to Congress pushing through another stimulus at the end of December, and if this report is also bad, it could reignite debate in Washington over the possibility of another stimulus.  Remember to monitor a couple of things when you check the report. First, which sectors saw job growth in December and which saw losses? It’s likely that the leisure and hospitality sector got hit hard by the shutdowns, but will manufacturing jobs growth be a little better considering the nice number we just heard Tuesday from the ISM on that part of the economy? Also, long-term joblessness is a big problem, and the unemployment rate doesn’t reflect that. In November, so-called “U6” unemployment was close to steady at 12%. The U6 rate includes discouraged workers who’ve quit looking for a job and part-time workers who are seeking full-time employment, and some economists think it’s a better measure of actual unemployment.

90,"In a surprising turn of events, Democrats appear poised to take over control of the Senate, potentially setting up at least two years of full Democratic control in Washington. What Happened? On Tuesday, Georgia held two Senate runoff elections. As of Wednesday morning, Democrat Rev. Raphael Warnock is the projected victor in one of the two Georgia Senate runoff races, while Democrat Jon Ossoff maintains a narrow lead in a second race that is still too close to call with an estimated 98% of the votes already tallied at publication time. Why It’s Important: Online prediction market PredictIt now estimates Democrats have a 97% chance of gaining control of the Senate. Two Democratic victories in Georgia would split the Senate 50-50 with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris getting the tie-breaking vote. Analysts and experts say Democratic control of the White House, Senate and House of Representatives would be great news for the Democratic agenda, but Democrats will have zero wiggle room on more progressive legislation. In the near-term, President-elect Joe Biden has reportedly said Senate control would potentially allow him to make more progressive cabinet picks. Investor Impact: Two areas in which investors could see a positive impact from a Democratic victory could be cannabis stocks and clean energy stocks. Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Pablo Zuanic said Democratic control of the Senate could be a “game changer” for cannabis stocks. “We go from speculating what President-elect Biden could have done for cannabis reform via Executive Order (or by directives/’memos’ from his incoming Attorney General) and if the Senate would have held a vote on the SAFE act (banking reform) would have even taken a vote, to a new world, in which the question is more about the timing and scope of much broader reform for the cannabis industry,” Zuanic wrote in a note this week. He said Trulieve Cannabis Corp TCNNF and Curaleaf Holdings Inc CURLF remain his top two stock picks among U.S. multi-state operators. Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said the outcome in Georgia could be great news for electric vehicle stocks and bad news for big tech stocks. “To be blunt, it’s a clear negative for Big Tech as ultimately with a Senate now likely controlled by Democrats we would expect much more scrutiny and sharper teeth around FAANG names with potential (although still a low risk) legislative changes to current antitrust laws now on the table,” Ives wrote in a note. Shares of Facebook, Inc. FB, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, Apple Inc. AAPL and other target tech stocks initially traded lower by more than 2% on Wednesday morning. Ives said EV stocks like Tesla Inc TSLA, General Motors Company GM and Fisker Inc FSR have a lot to gain from the Democratic sweep. “We believe a doubling down on EV tax credits and further consumer incentives and government initiatives around the EV sector will be on the horizon which is a major positive for Tesla, GM, Fisker, and other auto players/EV supply chain (QS, etc.),” Ives said. All three stocks opened higher on Wednesday morning. Benzinga’s Take: Wall Street initially appeared to see more overall negatives to a Democratic victory than positives, likely due to concerns over higher taxes and a potential increase in regulation. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY opened Wednesday’s session down about 0.5%, but was trading in positive territory at publication time. © 2024 Benzinga.com. Benzinga does not provide investment advice.

94,"Nio Inc's – ADR NIO  annual Nio Day  is just around the corner, and the Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer expected to unveil a host of new product and service offerings. Ahead of the event, speculation point toward the company dipping its heel into the entry-level EV market. What Happened:  Nio has entered into a contract with battery supplier CATL for procuring a production line of lithium iron phosphate batteries, Chinese media reported. The batteries are being tested and prepared for delivery, the reports said. Lithium iron phosphate batteries are cheaper, as they do not use more expensive nickel and cobalt, which allows a reduction in battery prices to below $80/kilowatt-hour, a  CNBC report  said. Related Link:  Nio Launches 'NIO Certified' Used Car Service in China Amid Competitive Pressure From Tesla  Why It's Important:  Lithium iron phosphate batteries are used by EV pioneer Tesla Inc TSLA in its China-made  Model 3 vehicles,  allowing the company to price competitively. Apart from easing cost pressure, the batteries also help to circumvent the safety concerns associated with ternary lithium batteries, cnTech Post reported. What's Next:  Nio is planning to launch entry-level models equipped with lithium iron phosphate batteries as soon as this year with the objective of meeting demands of price-sensitive consumers, local media reports said. The reports also said Nio's premium positioning in the market is unlikely to be impacted by the proposed plan.

The report says the Model Y costs Tesla 237,930 yuan ($36,800), but the company is selling the vehicle for 339,900 yuan ($52,600). Guosen Securities expects that over time, Tesla may lower the price of the Model Y, as it's done with previous vehicles over the years, while maintaining a 25% margin. The price could go as low as 260,000 ($40,200), the firm said.  The report also mentions the LFP battery version of the Model Y may be coming later in 2021. This points to a lower-cost version of the Model Y, similar to the Model 3 version Tesla debuted in China last year.  Click here to check out Benzinga's EV Hub for the latest electric vehicle news.  Benzinga's Take: If accurate, these margins are impressive. And if Tesla can lower the price of the Model Y to around $40,000, the competition will have a hard time catching up. Tesla already beats out competitors on range and driver assist features, with brand loyalty comparable to Apple.  Photo courtesy of Tesla. © 2024 Benzinga.com.

97,"In sports betting, there's an old phrase of “good teams win, great teams cover.” It's probably a stretch to use that phrase often in the world of exchange-traded funds, but indulge us as we say the ARK Industrial Innovation ETF ARKK did a lot of “covering” last year. What Happened: Famed for its exposure to Tesla TSLA, which is currently 10.76% of the fund, returned almost 153% last year. Said differently, the returns of the S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 Index could be combined then doubled and would still lag ARKK by a wide margin. In other words, the actively managed ARKK is deserving of the many superlatives it receives and it landed another one as CFRA Research's focus ETF for the month of January. ARKK typically holds 35 to 55 stocks and its member firms generally hail from disruptive origins, such as fintech, genomics, industrial innovation and next-generation internet. Why It's Important: Not surprisingly, much of the early fanfare surrounding ARKK revolved around its status as one of the largest ETF holders of Tesla stock. “According to CFRA Equity Analyst Garrett Nelson, TSLA just posted another solid quarter of operational execution and impressively almost hit an ambitious annual sales target despite the pandemic-related challenges,” writes Todd Rosenbluth, CFRA head of ETF and mutual fund research. “Following the stock’s spectacular 2020 performance, up more than 700%, capped off by an inclusion in the S&P 500 Index, Nelson views TSLA’s risk/reward as more balanced at current levels, justifying a Hold recommendation.” As highlighted by the $9.49 billion investors poured into ARKK last year, making it the largest actively managed ETF of any type, market participants grew fond of the fund for reasons beyond Tesla. Other familiar disruptive growth names in the fund include Roku ROKU, Square SQ and Spotify SPOT. CFRA Equity Analyst John Freeman recently upgraded Spotify, “seeing attractive valuation relative to SPOT’s long duration growth prospects and its emerging position as the leading independent global provider of audio entertainment and content, differentiated by its massive library of 1.9 million podcasts at the end of the third quarter, up 20% from the second quarter,” notes Rosenbluth. What's Next: Past performance isn't a guarantee of future returns, but long-term investors can take some comfort in knowing ARKK's stellar 2020 showing wasn't a one-off event. “ARKK’s five-star rating is aided by its consistent performance in the short and intermediate term, which contributes to its favorable safe risk score,” notes Rosenbluth. :ARKK more than doubled in value in 2020, but it is not a just recent strong performer. The ETF rose 87% in 2017 and 35% in 2019.” © 2024 Benzinga.com. Benzinga does not provide investment advice. All rights reserved.

At the start of 2010, e-commerce accounted for just 4.2% of total retail purchases in the U.S according to the Federal Reserve. By the end of 2019, that figure had risen to 11.3%. Then, the pandemic forced brick-and-mortar retailers to close, causing e-commerce traffic to skyrocket to all-time highs. While many investors believe that brick-and-mortar retail is dead, that is far from the truth according to Joey Agree. Agree serves as the President and CEO of Agree Realty ADC, a real estate investment trust (REIT) with an enterprise value of approximately $5 billion. Agree is spearheading their new initiative, Rethink Retail, aimed at challenging misperceptions about the future of brick-and-mortar retail. It is well documented that the pandemic has been great for e-commerce companies like Shopify Inc SHOP, Amazon.com Inc AMZN, and Etsy Inc ETSY, and equally as tough for large physical retailers with weak e-commerce operations. The Rethink Retail initiative is based on their belief that retailers will be more successful if they are able to command both e-commerce and physical presence. What’s really happening, according to Agree, is not retailers abandoning brick-and-mortar for e-commerce. It’s the realization that both are critically important in a 21st-century omnichannel world. “Retail real estate is going through fundamental changes in this country. In 10 years, obviously, e-commerce has expanded dramatically. I think everybody is well aware of that. What they aren’t aware of is e-commerce-based retailers have found that brick-and-mortar retail presence also helps their sales. So, what we think we’ll continue to see is brick-and-mortar being the linchpin for an omnichannel world.” “Omnichannel” refers to retailers giving their customers as many options as possible to shop. This includes online, in-person, mobile apps, mobile sites, same-day delivery, and buying online with pickup in-store (known as BOPIS). Agree pointed to the fact that many traditional retailers have beefed up their e-commerce operations (such as Walmart) while, at the same time, Amazon has invested heavily in its physical presence via Whole Foods, Amazon Locker, Amazon Go, returns at Kohl’s Corporation KSS and most recently the launch of Amazon Fresh, their newest entry into the brick and mortar channel. The downside of omnichannel is that, while great for consumers, it’s very expensive for retailers to compete. In addition to traditional costs of real estate and inventory management, retailers are also expected to scale their technology platforms and direct-to-consumer distribution. Not to mention compete on price across the board. As a result, Agree believes the larger retailers have an inherent advantage. This is why Agree Realty has focused on buying real estate leased to large national retailers that have the financial wherewithal to invest in their omnichannel operations while simultaneously competing on price. Walmart Inc WMT, Home Depot Inc HD, Lowe's Companies Inc LOW, AutoZone, Inc. AZO, and O’Reilly Automotive Inc ORLY are among Agree’s top tenants. Agree Realty built up a “war chest,” in Agree’s terms, —during April and used it to go on a shopping spree. In the third quarter, Agree Realty acquired approximately $460 million of real estate, about 80% of which is leased to retailers who fit that bill. “The regional and weaker national players that are stuck in the middle will be the losers in this transformation,” he said. “They don’t have the one-on-one customer relationship you have with your local merchant, and they also don’t have the access to capital to compete with the nationals in a highly competitive world.” The preceding post was written and/or published as a collaboration between Benzinga’s in-house sponsored content team and a financial partner of Benzinga.

99,"At the start of 2021, Tesla Inc TSLA opened up the order page for the Model Y in China. Tesla has been working to expand Gigafactory Shanghai to mass-produce the Model Y for sale in China and export to neighboring areas including Australia and parts of Europe. Now a report from Electrek shows Tesla has already received enough orders to exhaust its supply of the popular vehicle for the first three months of 2021. The order page has only been live for about six days, but the delivery estimate on Tesla's site is showing that orders will not be filled until the second quarter of 2021. The performance version is being quoted as available in the third quarter of the year. A study covered Tuesday said Tesla may already be producing 3,000 Model Ys per week at Gigafactory Shanghai. If accurate, that would mean Tesla received over 36,000 Model Y orders in six days, or 6,000 orders per day, double the amount of Model Y the company is currently able to produce.

100,"Apple Inc. AAPL launched its  Apple Fitness+  in mid-December. It allows users to work out anytime anywhere, a welcome proposition at a time when staying at home is preferred during the COVID-19 pandemic.  An analyst at Rosenblatt Securities said that awareness of the new offering — though growing — trails the rival offering by Peloton Interactive Inc PTON. Home Fitness Here To Stay: A workout at home is preferred by a majority, with most suggesting they will continue to maintain or increase this routine post the pandemic, analyst Bernie McTernan said in a note, citing the results of Rosenblatt's third Streaming Fitness survey. About 45% of the respondents said they use a streaming home fitness service, the analyst said, adding that 23% of the respondents use a free service, 14% use Apple Fitness+, 10% rely on Peloton and 15% use a paid service other than those of Apple and Peloton. Peloton Tops Apple In Awareness:  Awareness of Apple Fitness+ stood at 52% of the respondents compared to a relatively stable 68% for Peloton, McTernan said. Awareness about Apple Fitness+ is higher among respondents with an Apple Watch at 76% compared to 41% for those without, the analyst said.  Despite Apple Fitness+ being offered as a free service to Apple Watch owners for a month and for new Apple Watch buyers for three months, only less than one-quarter of those with an Apple Watch are trying Apple Fitness, he said.  Related Link:  Good Fit': Street Reacts To Peloton's $420M Precor Acquisition  Peloton's Low Penetration An Opportunity:  Given Peloton's product quality and focus on affordability, the low penetration of its streaming fitness service could be an opportunity, McTernan said. Peloton's moat is its content, with the company releasing 130 workouts over the last week relative to 24 by Apple Fitness+, adding to its considerable library lead, the analyst said.  ""On affordability, while we are focused on the launch of the value tread in February/March in the U.S., we also see an opportunity for a certified pre-owned market,"" he said.  McTernan has a Buy rating and $186 price target for Peloton shares. AAPL, PTON Price Action:  At last check, Apple shares were moving down 2.66% at $127.53 and Peloton shares were slipping 3.53% to $143.28.  Related Link:  Peloton CEO Says Apple Fitness+ Legitimizes Exercise Market  Photo courtesy of Peloton.  © 2024 Benzinga.com.

 The world's highest-selling 5G smartphone company, Apple Inc. (AAPL - Get Rating), delivered impressive numbers in its last quarterly earnings report. This, despite the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which continues to present an extremely volatile and challenging macro environment for industries worldwide. Since the onset  of the pandemic, AAPL's offerings have been essential for many companies and individuals to stay operational, and in some cases helped them thrive. As such, AAPL's services and Mac product revenues hit all-time highs. AAPL's revenue has grown in every segment. AAPL should benefit largely from its 5G-enabled iPhone line-up. These iPhone versions are expected to smash all previous sales records for its mobile phones. With increasing orders driven by outsized demand, the company should witness significant revenue growth this year. Apple's  prolific product innovations and introductions and the unmatched loyalty of its customers have helped  it gain 74% over the past year. This impressive performance, combined with several other factors, has helped AAPL earn a ""Strong Buy"" rating in our proprietary rating system. Here is how our proprietary POWR Ratings system evaluates AAPL: AAPL is currently trading above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages of $121.28 and $100.91, respectively, indicating that the stock is in an uptrend. Also, the stock has gained 14.5% over the past three months, reflecting solid short-term bullishness. AAPL's services revenue has increased 16.3% year-over-year to $14.55 billion in the fourth quarter ended September 30, 2020. Net Mac sales rose 29.2% from the prior-year quarter to $9.03 billion, while cash flow from operating activities rose 16.3% from the year-ago value to $80.67 billion. In December, AAPL announced the launch of AirPods Max with high-fidelity audio, active noise cancellation, and spatial audio. The company also recently introduced Apple Fitness+, which gives users the option to work-out anywhere and at any time with the screen that best suits them. These breakthrough products should  broaden AAPL's market reach and give a boost to its revenue. AAPL has also recently unveiled a new line of Mac products, such as the new MacBook Air, 13-inch MacBook Pro, and Mac mini powered by the M1 Processors–its first generation of internally produced chips. It is hoped that the new features in the new line-up will enable the company to provide seamless experiences to all its customers and by so doing drive business growth. In terms of proximity to its 52-week high, which is a key factor that our Buy & Hold Grade considers,  AAPL is well positioned. The stock is currently trading just 5.9% below its 52-week high of $138.79, which it hit on December 29. The company's net revenue has grown at a CAGR of 6.2% over the past three years, while net income increased at a CAGR of 5.9% over this period. Also, AAPL's EPS has increased at a CAGR of 12.5% over the past three years. This can be attributed to its continued investments in innovative platforms to better serve its large and loyal customer base. AAPL is currently ranked #1 of 39 stocks in the Technology – Hardware industry. Other popular stocks in this industry are Dell Technologies Inc. (DELL - Get Rating), HP Inc. (HPQ - Get Rating) and Koninklijke Philips N.V. (PHG - Get Rating) PHG, HPQ, and DELL gained 16.3%, 17.4%, and 43.4%, respectively, over the past year. This compares to AAPL's 74% returns over this period. The Technology – Hardware industry is ranked #2 of the 123 StockNews.com industries. The companies in this industry are involved in the production of smartphones, personal computers, cameras, monitors, keyboards, mice, and webcams, as well as ATMs, self-service kiosks, point-of-sale terminals, and biometric readers. Remote work, online education and social distancing have created a massive demand for products and services delivered by the tech industry. It has successfully weathered past crises and found novel ways to emerge stronger than ever. In fact, tech companies have been leading the way for other industries to survive the crisis. AAPL is rated ""Strong Buy"" due to its impressive financials, short- and long-term bullishness, solid price momentum, and underlying industry strength, as determined by the four components of our overall POWR Rating. AAPL is well positioned to outperform the broader market this year despite gaining 74% over the past year. With iPad and Mac sales growing substantially because of COVID-19-related work- and learn-from-home trends, the company should witness long-term strength in wearable and services revenue. Analyst sentiment, which gives a good sense of a stock's future price movement, is good for AAPL. It has an average broker rating of 1.51, indicating favorable analyst sentiment. Of38 Wall Street analysts that rated the stock, 11 rated it a ""Strong Buy."" The consensus EPS estimate of $0.88 for the quarter ending March 31, 2021 represents  a 37.5% improvement year-over-year. Moreover, AAPL has an impressive earnings surprise history, with the company beating consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. A consensus revenue estimate of $73.15 billion for the next quarter represents  a 25.4% increase from the same period last year. We think this outlook should keep AAPL's momentum alive.

102,"Tesla Inc TSLA gained another 2.8% on Wednesday and is now up 1,560% in the past 18 months. While Tesla bulls are betting the stock’s insane run will continue following a Democratic Senate sweep in Georgia, some Tesla option traders are dumping massive amounts of call options on Wednesday. Related Link: What A Democratic Victory In Georgia's Runoff Election Means For The Stock Market  The Tesla Trades: On Wednesday morning, Benzinga Pro subscribers received dozens of alerts related to unusually large Tesla option trades. Here are the four largest: Why It's Important: Even traders who stick exclusively to stocks often monitor option market activity closely for unusually large trades. Given the relative complexity of the options market, large options traders are typically considered to be more sophisticated than the average stock trader. Many of these large options traders are wealthy individuals or institutions who may have unique information or theses related to the underlying stock. Unfortunately, stock traders often use the options market to hedge against their larger stock positions, and there’s no surefire way to determine if an options trade is a standalone position or a hedge. In this case, given the relatively large size of the largest Tesla option trades, there’s certainly a possibility they could be an institutional hedge on a large position in Tesla stock. Tesla Investors Cashing In: Wednesday’s big option trades come after Tesla reported a record 180,570 vehicle deliveries in the fourth quarter, up 29.6% compared to the third quarter. That number exceeded analyst estimates of 174,000 vehicles. For the full year of 2020, Tesla delivered 499,550 vehicles. Tesla bulls highlight the fact that growth of any kind is impressive given the difficult 2020 environment, while bears point out that Tesla’s 800% increase in market cap isn’t exactly in-line with its 35.9% increase in deliveries. Tesla had previously said it would “comfortably exceed” 500,000 vehicle deliveries in 2020. CEO Elon Musk had also said Tesla would have a million robotaxis in operation in 2020. Tesla investors are hoping Democrats in control of the White House and Congress will provide a significant tailwind for clean energy stocks. On Wednesday, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said a sweep in Georgia would be particularly bullish for electric vehicle stocks like Tesla, General Motors Company GM and Fisker Inc FSR. Benzinga’s Take: The four largest option trades on Wednesday morning were all call sales, and they represented an aggregate of more than $44 million in bearish Tesla option trading volume. Tesla bulls can’t be upset about option traders cashing out on what could potentially be massive trading gains on these calls after Tesla’s historic run. © 2024 Benzinga.com.

112,"Tesla Inc TSLA CEO Elon Musk is close to snagging the title of the world’s richest person from Amazon.com Inc AMZN CEO Jeff Bezos, as per Bloomberg Billionaire’s Index. What Happened: The automotive and space entrepreneur is just $3 billion short of beating Bezos to the top spot in the Bloomberg ranking of the super-rich. While Musk’s wealth stood at $181.1 billion as of Wednesday, Bezos was worth $184 billion. Tesla shares shot up nearly 3% on Wednesday and another 1% in the after-hours trading. CNBC wealth reporter Robert Frank noted that if Tesla's shares surged more than 1.6% in the next trading session, Musk could be the world's richest person on Wednesday. Why It Matters: The Palo Alto-based automaker was added to the S&P 500 index last month. When the move was announced in November, Musk's wealth was reportedly at $117 billion, having gained $90 billion till the point. The entrepreneur has — since the announcement of Tesla’s addition — added another $13 billion to his kitty.  Musk owns 21% of Tesla’s stock and is likely to add more shares to his name thanks to a 2018 compensation plan that rewards stock performance and financials in 12 tranches of stock options. In October, Musk unlocked a tranche that gave him nearly 1% of Tesla’s outstanding and translated into 8.44 million options to buy Tesla shares for nearly $70 each.

114,"Apple Inc AAPL said Wednesday that sales of digital products like apps on its platform skyrocketed during the holiday season. What Happened: App Store customers spent $1.8 billion in the week extending from Christmas Eve to New Year’s Eve, with games driving most sales, the company said in a statement.  Popular gaming titles this year included “Among Us” and “Roblox.” See Also: Why Apple Is Removing Video Games From App Store In China A record for single-day spending was made on New Year’s Day when users poured $540 million on digital products, as per Apple. The Tim Cook-led company said that Zoom Video Communications, Inc’s ZM video conferencing app and Walt Disney Company’s DIS streaming app were among the most downloaded apps in 2020. “Now more than ever before, customers around the world have found inspiration and value in the breadth and quality of Apple’s services, which have impacted their lives in big and small ways every day,” said Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of Internet Software and Services. Why It Matters: The Cupertino, California-based company recognized that apps have become “more essential than ever” in a year dominated by a raging coronavirus pandemic. In November, the tech giant slashed its App Store fee to 15% from 30% as part of a program aimed at small businesses.  The iPhone maker revealed that beginning this week many inaugural participants would join that effort called the App Store Small Business Program. See Also: Apple Exempts Virtual Events From Paying 30% App Store Cut Through June Apple’s product sales which make up for 77.5% of its total revenues shrank 2.7% as per the company’s fourth-quarter results but its services revenue rose 16.3% to $14.55 billion.

115,"Alphabet Inc’s GOOGL GOOG subsidiary Waymo announced in its blog that henceforth the company would address its mobility services as ""fully autonomous driving technology,"" and ditch the term ""self-driving."" What Happened: Starting with the fully-autonomous labeling, Waymo’s blog said that its technology is distinctly separate from the driver assistance systems of other automakers that require human intervention. While Waymo didn't name any automaker directly, it has contested the claims of Tesla Inc.'s TSLA full self-driving being at par with its autonomous driving technology before.   Waymo said that accurately wording the technology could also save lives. Of late, Tesla has been mired in safety-related controversies, which picked up much more steam after a fatal crash in South Korea led to two people being injured and one fatality. At the beginning of 2020, Tesla faced 14 scrutinies by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) for accidents that involved its autopilot systems. Why Does It Matter: Waymo clarified that erroneously branding driver assists as fully autonomous sends a wrong message to auto buyers and enthusiasts. The post suggested that misleading impressions could inflate the ability of the vehicle and result in an unnecessary risk to drivers, passengers, and others on the road. ""Unfortunately, we see that some automakers use the term 'self-driving' in an inaccurate way, giving consumers and the general public a false impression of the capabilities of driver assist (not fully autonomous) technology,"" Waymo said. ""That false impression can lead someone to unknowingly take risks (like taking their hands off the steering wheel) that could jeopardize not only their own safety but the safety of people around them."" Price Action: GOOG stock closed at $1,735.29, 0.32% lower whereas GOOGL fell 0.99% to close Wednesday at $1,722.98.

116,"  Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (NASDAQ: WBA) disclosed on Wednesday that it had signed an agreement with healthcare products distributor AmerisourceBergen Corp (NYSE: ABC) to sell a majority stake in its Alliance Healthcare business. The deal is valued at $6.5 billion and is expected to close by the end of the fiscal year 2021. What Happened: Of the total transaction value, AmerisourceBergen will pay $6.275 billion in cash and the balance by the issue of 2 million shares. Walgreens Boots Alliance, on the other hand, plans to grow its retail pharmacy business. Both the companies have also agreed to extend their distribution agreement in the U.S. by three years through 2029. The U.K. division of Alliance Healthcare will continue to act as Boots’ distribution partner for the next ten years. The whole pharmacy unit sale comes as Walgreens intends to focus on its retail pharmacies and health initiatives since it faces fresh competition from Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) and rival CVS Health Corp (NYSE: CVS), the Wall Street Journal notes. Why Does It Matter: Benefits from the Walgreens – AmerisourceBergen deal are expected to grow for the next three years and achieve annual run-rate synergies of approximately $150 million in the fourth year. Both companies will share financial benefits in equal proportions. In the first year, AmerisourceBergen’s adjusted diluted EPS is anticipated to grow in the high-teens. The free cash flow for AmerisourceBergen and Alliance Healthcare could collectively increase by 125% of AmerisourceBergen’s stand-alone forecasts. Walgreens Boots Alliance’s adjusted EBITDA in FY2021 for the Alliance healthcare business is estimated between $575 million to $580 million. Price Action: On Wednesday, WBA shares gained 4.54% to close at $43.03, and ABC rallied 8.6% to close at $106.17. Image Courtesy: Wikimedia © 2024 Benzinga.com.

117,"The U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) office released findings in a press release on Wednesday that the digital tax regulations in India, Italy, and Turkey are not in line with the international taxation principles, and it negatively impacts United States commerce. Despite the findings, the USTR has decided to hold off retaliatory actions for now. What Happened: The investigation centered around the Digital Services Tax (DST) imposed on American tech companies. The U.S. trade body published individual findings report for each of the three countries on its website. Many of the U.S. tech giants including Amazon Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN), Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB), Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL), and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) fall under the purview of these DST regulations. India levies a 2% tax liability for revenues generated locally through digital platforms and online content, software-as-a-service, etc. Italy is imposing a 3% tax rate on the total taxable revenues, whereas Turkey introduced the possibility of raising the maximum allowable tax rate to 15%. Turkey’s current DST rate is 7.5%. Why It Matters: According to Bloomberg, the Czech Republic and Spain will begin digital tax collections from January 2021, while other European countries like Norway, Belgium, and Latvia will initiate the rule this year. The USTR kicked off the Section 301 investigations against these three countries in June 2020, in tandem with the DST considerations in Austria, Brazil, the Czech Republic, the European Union, Indonesia, Spain, and the United Kingdom per the press release. France carried through with its local version of the DST in 2019, and after talks with President Donald Trump faltered, began collecting in mid-December 2020. The USTR pondered implementing a 25% tariff levy on certain French products with an estimated total import value of $1.3 billion per year, reports Reuters. Price Action: On Thursday, AMZN closed 2.49% lower at $3,138.38, FB was down 2.83% to $263.21, AAPL fell 3.32% at $126.66, and GOOG closed at $1,735.29 with a 0.32% decrease. © 2024 Benzinga.com.

119,"California Governor Gavin Newsom proposed elements from the 2021-22 state budget on Tuesday that included a $4.5 billion stimulus for “Equitable Recovery for California’s Businesses and Jobs plan” to help California recover through the COVID-19 pandemic. Newsom called for immediate action to support small businesses with an additional $575 million on top of the previously allocated $500 million.  The budget also included the “Zero-Emission Vehicles and Zero-Emission Vehicle Infrastructure” plan, which proposed to allocate an additional $1.5 billion investment towards clean energy vehicles. What Happened: California has committed to the goal of zero-emission new vehicle sales of all passenger vehicles by 2035. The proposed budget allocates $1.5 billion to accelerate towards the fulfillment of the goal. If passed, it could boost electric vehicle and hydrogen vehicle sales as $1.5 billion is earmarked to help people and businesses purchase electric or hydrogen vehicles and equipment and invest in construction and maintenance of charging and fueling infrastructure. Why It Matters: The proposal includes $300 million for “greening’ of state infrastructure, which allows the installation of electric vehicle charging stations at all state-owned facilities, CNBC reports. Charging stations from Tesla Inc TSLA, Switchback Energy Acquisition’s SBE, ChargePoint Inc, and Electrify America stand to benefit from the allocation.  As per Sam Fiorani, the AutoForecast Solutions Vice President of Global Vehicle Forecasting, eleven new EVs are set to enter the domestic market, including and updated Tesla Model S. Imported EVs like Nissan Motor Co Ltd NSANY Ariya and Volkswagen A G’s VWAGY ID.4 would also go on sale in California.

 Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk is just $3 billion away from becoming not only the world’s richest person, but potentially the richest man in human history. According to Bloomberg’s Billionaire Index, the SpaceX and Tesla founder is currently worth $181 billion, just shy of the world’s richest man and Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos at $184 billion. Bezos has held the title of world’s richest person since October 2017. Tesla shares, which have raced higher by 668% year-over-year, gained nearly 3% on Wednesday. CNBC’s Robert Frank noted in a tweet that if the ticker jumps by more than 1.6% in today’s trading session, Musk becomes the world’s richest person. Elon Musk’s net worth catapulted even higher after Tesla’s shares were added to the S&P 500 (^GSPC) index. The announcement of the move triggered a new wave of buying of the electric carmaker’s shares, sending the company’s market cap above $500 billion and boosting the value of Musk’s 21% holding in the business.  It should be noted that since the announcement of Tesla’s S&P addition, Musk has seen his net worth increase by another $13 billion-and in the process overtake Microsoft’s Bill Gates to become the world’s second-richest person with $128 billion. Before the November announcement, Elon Musk’s net worth, which was $184.5 billion on January 6, was reportedly at $117 billion.  Musk has managed to increase his net worth, which is inextricably tied with Tesla’s stock price, by more than $150 billion over the last 52 weeks. Tesla shares gained 2.8% by the close of trading Wednesday and changed hands at $735.11 each. Ticker is up 35 points, or $4.74%, in Thursday’s early trading hours giving the EV maker a market value of more than $716 billion. Disclaimer: This page contains affiliate links.

123,"Two of the hottest investing stories of 2020 was the insane rise of both Bitcoin and Tesla Inc TSLA. Neither show signs of slowing down in 2021 and continue to climb the ladder in terms of value. What Happened: Bitcoin briefly passed the value of Tesla on Thursday morning. Bitcoin had a market capitalization of $717 billion, which would make the cryptocurrency the sixth most valuable company in the world according to AssetDash if it was a publicly-traded company. Tesla took back the sixth position a short time later with shares up 4% to $788.60 in early Thursday trading. Related Link: 8 Stocks To Play Bitcoin’s Resurgence Why It’s Important: The increase in the value of Bitcoin has sent the cryptocurrency above some of the most well-known financial companies in the world. See also: How to Buy Bitcoin (BTC) In 2020, Bitcoin passed JPMorgan Chase JPM, Mastercard Inc MA and Visa Inc V. The crypto recently passed Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-A)(NYSE: BRK-B), the company of the legendary Warren Buffett who once called Bitcoin “rat poison.” In 2021, Bitcoin has already moved up two placed in the top 10 list with a possible third if it can move past Tesla. The move up the ladder comes with the surge in Bitcoin and also the shrinking valuation in two Chinese stocks. Tencent TCEHY and Alibaba Group Holding BABA fell three places this week combined. What’s Next: If Bitcoin can pass Tesla again, it would have its eyes next on technology giant Facebook Inc FB. Facebook has a valuation of $769.4 billion. With 18,593,631 Bitcoin currently out, the price of the cryptocurrency would have to rise to around $41,380 to pass Facebook. Bitcoin will need to hit around $40,172 to keep up with Tesla's Thursday rise.  Price Action: Bitcoin trades around $38,540 at publication time. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust GBTC is up 8% to $47.42 Thursday and has gained over 380% over the past year. © 2024 Benzinga.com. Benzinga does not provide investment advice. All rights reserved.

124,"Chinese electric vehicle startup Xpeng Inc – ADR XPEV will soon launch its third model, expanding its product pipeline. What Happened:  XPeng teased via a series of tweets a new sedan model that is in the offing, although few details were shared.  Hello. Nice to meet you. #ElectricVehicles #SmartEV #DriveDifferent pic.twitter.com/WFbwFijdsU XPeng's third production model is set for mass production in 2021, the company told Benzinga in an email.  ""The only thing we can share now is that it will be equipped with lidar. Other details will have to wait,"" an XPeng spokesperson said. XPeng revealed at the Guangzhou Auto Show in late November that it will unveil the first production car with lidar technology in 2021. Automotive lidar or light image, detection and ranging, is a technology that uses sensors to emit invisible laser lights to scan and detect objects in the vicinity and create a 3D image of the surroundings on the display screen. Related Link: Xpeng Reports 112% Rise In 2020 Deliveries: What Investors Need To Know  The vehicle appears more compact than XPeng's P7 sedan, and therefore could be less expensive, which than the P7's starting price of 229,900 yuan ($35,550) after subsidies, a cnTech Post report said. Why It's Important:  The  Chinese EV market is touted a lucrative opportunity, allowing multiple players to operate profitably. Homebred competitors such as XPeng, Nio Inc – ADR NIO, BYD, Li Auto Inc. LI and U.S. EV giant Tesla Inc TSLA are all vying for a piece of this market. Nio is expected to launch its first-ever sedan at the Nio Day event scheduled for this weekend. Separately, XPeng is expected to hold a Navigation Guided Pilot beta experience event Jan. 11 that will be open to select users and media, cnTech Post reported.

125,"Tesla Inc TSLA CEO Elon Musk woke up Thursday morning a few billion dollars short of becoming the richest person in the world. After Tesla's 5% gain in early trading, he actually surpassed Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN CEO Jeff Bezos to officially become the world's richest person, according to CNBC. What Happened: Musk owned 38.66 million shares of Tesla, according to a late 2020 regulatory filing. The stock's $40 per share gain means he's now worth more than $185 billion, good enough to outrank Bezos' net worth of around $184 billion. However, it might be premature for Musk to break out the champagne -- assuming he was planning to celebrate in the first place. According to Forbes' real-time billionaire's list, the Amazon chief is worth $186.4 billion after the stock's early morning move higher. The minor differences could be attributed to how each outlet calculates Musk and Bezos' holdings in private companies, such as Musk's SpaceX or Bezos' ownership of The Washington Post. It's likely Bezos and Musk will switch places with each other for the title as the world's richest person for a little while. We may have a clear winner in the coming weeks or months if the two stocks move in opposite directions. Well, back to work … How Musk Got Here: Musk entered 2020 worth $28 billion and closed the year valued at around $175 billion, according to Celebrity Net Worth. Tesla's stock skyrocketed nearly 800% in 2020 to close the year at over $700. Investors that bought the stock near the March lows at $70.10 are sitting on a gain of more than 1,000%. For anyone keeping track, Tesla's stock is up nearly 1,700% over a five-year period versus Amazon's 471% gain. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Tesla's stock at its (split-adjusted) IPO price of around $3.40 would be worth around $235,000 today. However, a similar $1,000 investment in Amazon's split-adjusted IPO price of $1.50 in 1994 would have been sufficient for an investor to become a millionaire had they held the stock over the decades. © 2024 Benzinga.com.

However, a similar $1,000 investment in Amazon's split-adjusted IPO price of $1.50 in 1994 would have been sufficient for an investor to become a millionaire had they held the stock over the decades. © 2024 Benzinga.com.

127,"The pandemic has caused the e-commerce stocks last year to skyrocket to unprecedented heights. Shopify Inc SHOP and Etsy Inc ETSY profited from the trend, with Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN taking the throne. But, their stocks could rise even higher this year as online retail is here to stay. Along these three solid long-term investments, overseas e-commerce companies such as MercadoLibre Inc MELI, Baozun Inc BZUN, and Pinduoduo Inc PDD are just as attractive yet are frequently overlooked. MercadoLibre is the largest e-commerce company in Latin America that operates in 18 countries. Its three top markets are Brazil that contributed 65% to its total revenue last quarter, Argentina that accounted for 19%, followed by Mexico at 12%. At the end of 2015, its registered userbase grew from 144.6 million to 320.6 million by the end of 2019, while it added 46.8 million more during the first nine months of 2020. MercadoLibre is benefiting from the shift from physical to online stores across Latin America, rising internet penetration rates, and its first-mover's advantage in the market. These favorable trends are offsetting recessions and brutal currency headwinds across the region. In 2019, MercadoLibre saw robust growth across its top markets, with overall revenue rising 60%. It grew another 63% YoY during the first nine months of 2020 as more people shopped online throughout the pandemic. Baozun is an e-commerce services company that helps overseas companies such as Nike Inc NKE and PepsiCo, Inc. PEP establish their e-commerce platforms in China. Large brands use its services to avoid hiring local teams or having to build their own infrastructure. Baozun generates most of its revenue from such big customers by providing an end-to-end platform that handles all of their operations, logistics, IT and marketing needs, saving them the need to hire local teams or build their own infrastructure. Baozun stabilized its earnings growth by gradually replacing its ""distribution-based"" model with an asset-light ""non-distribution"" model that lets clients ship orders directly to customers. Revenue rose 35% in 2019 and grew another 22% YoY during the first nine months of 2020. Growth was hampered by trade wars which caused some overseas companies to review their dependence on China, and China's faster recovery from the pandemic, which limited its overall boost to online sales. Having served 731 million active buyers over the past twelve months, Pinduoduo is the third-largest e-commerce company in China. It follows Alibaba Group Holding Ltd BABA and JD.Com Inc JD. Although it was founded only half a decade ago, it rapidly expanded by encouraging shoppers to team up on bulk purchases and take advantage of extreme discounts. Its approach appealed to China's lower-tier cities and turned it into a leading platform for shipping fresh fruits and vegetables. Alibaba and JD both launched their own discount marketplaces to combat Pinduoduo's growth, but their efforts did not succeed to hamper its growth rate. In 2019, its revenue soared 130%. During the first nine months of 2020, it went more up 70% YoY. Pinduoduo's stock has more than quadrupled over the past 12 months. Looking ahead, Alibaba's antitrust issues could bring more sellers to Pinduoduo that were previously locked in by the giant. COVID brought a spike in the annual growth of e-commerce as retail closures led consumers to shift their spending online. Everybody knew that retail digitalization was coming but no one knew exactly when. It did not only arrive, but it did so with a bang. The challenge now is to manage that explosion as there will be no certainty before a new normal arrives. The only certainty is that there is no going back, both in 2021 and beyond.

In fact, Bitcoin briefly passed the value of Tesla TSLA on Thursday morning. Bitcoin had a market capitalization of $717 billion, which would make the cryptocurrency the sixth most valuable company in the world according to AssetDash if it was a publicly-traded company. The combined market valuation of cryptocurrencies crossed the $1 trillion mark late Wednesday, per data from CoinMarketCap. Bitcoin traded around $40,216.50 at publication time, according to Coinbase data. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust GBTC was up 8% to $47.54 per share. © 2024 Benzinga.com.

135,"In December, it was reported Apple Inc AAPL was working to design an all-electric, self-driving car. At the time, the car was rumored to aim for a release in 2024 and take on Tesla Inc TSLA in the race for a fully autonomous vehicle. A new report from Bloomberg states Apple will take five to seven years to launch an autonomous car as the company is still in the early stages of development, with a rather small team. The team of Apple engineers are developing drive systems and vehicle interior and exterior with the goal of eventually shipping a self-driving vehicle. Apple has also added more ex-Tesla employees to the team. It seems Apple may be taking a similar approach to Tesla. While previous rumors stated Apple was mostly working on the self-driving systems, the company now seems to be taking everything in house, designing an entire vehicle around the self-driving concept. Tesla has taken a similar approach, designing its own vehicles, batteries, autonomous software, and even designing its own computer chips, a move Apple itself recently made, after Tesla. Click here to check out Benzinga's EV Hub for the latest electric vehicle news A key differentiator is that Apple doesn't manufacture its own products. Apple will most likely need to rely on manufacturing from outside companies, which could cut into profit margins. Tesla's profit margins are rumored to be above 20% per vehicle, according to recent studies. © 2024 Benzinga.com. Benzinga does not provide investment advice. All rights reserved.

138,"The Xbox gaming console is the subject of a Bloomberg piece titled “Xbox: The oral history and an American video game empire” that explores Microsoft Corporation's MSFT decision to get into gaming — and some failed acquisitions. What Happened: Before releasing the Xbox console, Microsoft approached several gaming companies about acquisitions so it could have exclusives to compete against Sony Corporation SNE. Microsoft approached Electronic Arts EA, which was considered one of the top gaming companies at the time. Microsoft met with Electronic Arts more than five times, but left empty-handed on a deal, the report said.  After failing to acquire Electronic Arts, Microsoft turned to Nintendo Co NTDOY. “They just launched their asses off. Like, imagine an hour of somebody just laughing at you. That was kind of how that meeting went,” said Kevin Bachus, who was director of third-party relationships for Microsoft at the time. Microsoft reportedly met again with Nintendo in January 2020 to pitch the company on a joint venture. The pitch was that Nintendo wasn’t good at hardware but was strong in the games business with Mario and other brands. Microsoft said they would take care of the hardware. Nintendo declined the joint venture as well. Microsoft also tried to acquire Square, now known as Square Enix, the makers of the “Final Fantasy” franchise games, and Midway, known for the “Mortal Kombat” games. The acquisition that was completed by Microsoft prior to the Xbox release was of Bungie, the makers of the popular “Halo” franchise. Microsoft acquired Bungie and was able to enjoy the success of the exclusive “Halo” games for many years. Related Link: 6 Video Game Stocks To Watch In 2021 Why It’s Important: Exclusive games can be a key differentiator for video game consoles. The success of the Playstation 5 could be in part due to exclusives like “Spider-Man: Miles Morales” and “MLB The Show.” Microsoft acquired ZeniMax Media in 2020, which gives it control of franchises like “Dishonored,” “Fallout,” “Doom” and “The Elder Scrolls.” The company could look to launch exclusive titles to complement its “Halo” games and better compete with Sony. Microsoft may have failed 20 years ago at acquiring any of the mentioned companies, but the Xbox has been a hit for the company, and Microsoft now has a gaming division worth billions of dollars annually. © 2024 Benzinga.com.

139,"Given the high cost of electric vehicles, government subsidies and incentives are a major factor that can alleviate the financial burden on manufacturers and prospective customers. What Happened:  Tesla Inc TSLA has opposed an incentive scheme that is being discussed by the South Korean government to promote new energy vehicle sales, The Korea Times reported.  The new policy would require local automakers increase the share of green energy vehicles, and those that meet the standard would be rewarded, while the rest would be penalized, the report said. Although the terms of the policy have not been worked out concretely, it is expected that companies meeting the standards will be able to sell excess credits in the market to other companies. Tesla reportedly complained that the policy is against the equitable treatment mandated for both foreign and domestic players under the Korean-U.S. Free Trade Agreement. A government official clarified that the policy is proposed to motivate traditional automakers to switch to green energy vehicles, and therefore it does not make sense to pay subsidies to a pure play EV company such as Tesla, the Korea Times reported.  Related Link: 2 Tesla Analysts Break Down Fundamentals, Valuation, China Prospects After Q4 Delivery Report  The government is reportedly planning to work out the final framework of the policy by the end of 2021 and assess automaker green energy vehicle production in 2022.  Fines would be levied on defaulters by 2023 and the amount collected would be used to set up infrastructure for eco-friendly cars, the report said. Regulatory Credits In The US, China:  The zero-emission vehicle regulations adopted by several states in the U.S. and other countries mandate that a certain proportion of vehicles sold by automakers should be green energy vehicles. EV manufacturers such as Tesla earn credits,  while the traditional automakers who fail to meet the standard buy regulatory credits from those who earn it in order to avoid paying hefty fines. In China, each new energy vehicle is assigned a specific number of credits depending on metrics such as electric range, energy efficiency and the rated power of fuel cell systems. Vehicles boasting higher performance are eligible for more credit, with the maximum credits at six per vehicle.

140,"The protests at the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday and the videos released by President Donald Trump afterward have forced companies to decide whether to take a stand against the outgoing president and if anything he said violates their terms. The violence and protests that happened on Wednesday have seen entrepreneurs and leading investors call on social media sites to remove the Trump accounts. Information shared by the accounts could have inspired some of Wednesday’s protests. See Also: Big Tech CEOs Condemn Capitol Violence, Term It 'Shameful,' 'Antithesis Of Democracy' What Happened: Twitter Inc TWTR took down a post from Trump on Wednesday night and announced a temporary ban on the account. The account will also have to remove offensive tweets and tweets with misinformation before being reinstated. Facebook Inc FB originally announced a 24-hour ban to Trump on both Facebook and Instagram due to policy violations. On Thursday, CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced the company was banning Trump indefinitely. “We believe the risks of allowing the President to continue to use our service during this period are simply too great,” Zuckerberg said in a statement. The ban will last at least through the next two weeks “until the peaceful transition of power is complete.” Shopify SHOP announced it was pulling the Donald Trump stores off its platform, according to The Wall Street Journal. “Shopify does not tolerate actions that incite violence. We have determined that the actions by President Donald J. Trump violate our Acceptable Use Policy,” the company said in a statement. Shopify hosts shops related to Trump’s campaign paraphernalia and his personal brand with the Trump Store. Twitch, owned by Amazon.com AMZN, told IGN it's disabling Trump’s channel over the risk of more violence. The streaming company didn't state how long the ban would last. “We believe this is a necessary step to protect our community and prevent Twitch from being used to incite further violence,” the company told IGN. YouTube, owned by Alphabet Inc GOOGGOOGL, is temporarily restricting channels that post misinformation including the channel of President Trump, according to The Verge. The company announced a strike system that will lock accounts from posting for a week instead of simply removing videos. Photo by Emily Elconin. © 2024 Benzinga.com.

142,"Apple Inc AAPL and Hyundai Motor Company HYMTF are conducting early negotiations on the development of self-driving electric vehicles, Bloomberg reported Thursday. What Happened: The South Korean automaker initially confirmed through a statement that the two companies are holding talks. “Apple and Hyundai are in discussion, but as it is at early stage, nothing has been decided,” Hyundai said, as per Bloomberg. The automaker later backtracked from the statement, saying it had received interest from a number of automakers. Apple is not only collaborating with Hyundai to produce EVs but also to develop electric batteries, the Korea Economic Daily reported earlier. The launch of the Apple Car is reportedly targeted for 2027. Hyundai Motor shares rallied 16.5% at press-time in Seoul after the report came to light.  Why It Matters: Apple and Hyundai are expected to promote battery development at either Hyundai Motor or Kia Motors’ factories in the United States, as per local Korean media. The Tim Cook-led company is taking a similar approach to Tesla Inc TSLA in that it would be taking everything in-house and designing an EV around the self-driving concept.

145,"Tesla Inc TSLA launched a new Standard RWD version of its Model Y sports utility vehicle, which now comes with a third-row seven-seat option. What Happened: The price for the Standard Range Rear-Wheel Drive Model Y is $40,490 — and potentially $34,190, post subsidies, according to Tesla’s website.  The Elon Musk-led company already sells two other types of All-Wheel Drive SUVs — the Model Y Long Range Dual Motor and the Tesla Model Y Performance for $42,190 and $52,190 respectively, after factoring in subsidies.                The seven-seat layout will cost an additional $3,000 and is available across Model Y variants. Why It Matters: The RWD Standard Range Plus model of the Model 3 sedan starts at $34,190, post subsidies, which means the price difference between that vehicle and the Model Y RWD version is now just $4,000.  Tesla lists the estimated range for the RWD Model Y as 244 miles. In July, Musk had said that the automaker would not produce the RWD version of the SUV as the range would be “unacceptably low.” Benzinga EV Insights noted in August that Tesla was moving much faster to release multiple Model Y trims compared with Model 3’s launch timeline. Price Action: Tesla shares closed nearly 7.9% at $816.04 on Thursday and gained 1.65% at $829.50 in the after-hours session.

147,"Tesla Inc’s TSLA Model 3 emerged as the top-selling battery electric vehicle (BEV) for 2020 in the United Kingdom and was the best selling auto overall in the last month of that year, Electrek reported Thursday. What Happened: For the entire year, the Model 3 emerged as the top-selling BEV, with Nissan’s LEAF taking the second spot.  The third position among BEVs was taken by Renault SAs RNLSY ZOE with Volkswagen’s AG’s VWAGY ID.3 and Kia Motor Company’s Niro giving close competition.  BEVs that sold at least 5000 units in 2020 — ranked in the order of popularity — include Tata Motors Limited’s TTM Jaguar I-Pace, MG ZS, Volkswagen’s Audi e-tron, and Bayerische Motoren Werke AG’s BMWYY i3.  The Elon Musk-led company sold 5,798 Model 3 vehicles in December, while the total battery electric vehicles stood at 21,914. Volkswagen AG’s VWAGY ID.3 came in fourth at 3,188 units sold in December. The second and third spots were occupied by traditional autos — Volkswagen’s Golf and Ford Motor Company’s F Fiesta. Why It Matters: The U.K. is set to end the sales of internal combustion engine (ICE) cars and vans by 2030, a decade earlier than the initially announced target in October 2018, noted Electrek. The British government has put in place incentives for both car buyers and manufacturers in terms of charge points and battery production and Electrek expects sales to jump on a massive scale next year despite the COVID-19 pandemic. However, Tesla is also getting tough competition in Europe and has already lost the 2020 top spot in Norway to Volkswagen, as per the Norwegian Road Federation (OFV).  See Also: 6 Auto Stocks To Watch As UK Moves Up ICE Ban Price Action: Tesla shares closed nearly 7.9% higher at $816.04 on Thursday and gained 1.65% in the after-hours session at $829.50.

148,"Baidu Inc BIDU becomes the latest tech giant entrant in the lucrative self-driving electric vehicle market. Reuters reported that Baidu has tied-up with Chinese automaker Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd GELYF to create a standalone EV company. Baidu is also looking to raise $3.5 billion from its secondary listing in Hong Kong. What Happened: Chinese search giant Baidu will own a majority stake in the new smart EV company, while Geely will retain a minority stake. The venture will use Baidu’s software capabilities and Geely’s existing car manufacturing facilities and engineering. Though the plan remains private, Reuters sources say that both companies intend to use Geely’s EV-focused platform, Sustainable Experience Architecture (SEA), for product development. Baidu is already developing autonomous driving technology and internet connectivity infrastructure. It also has its own navigation system app and voice assistant technology called DuerOS.  The search giant’s driverless software named Apollo is used in public robotaxi trials in Beijing. Baidu is also looking to list in Hong Kong in the first half of 2021 and raise $3.5 billion based on its latest valuation of $70 billion, Bloomberg reports. It has joined a wave of U.S.-listed Chinese firms seeking to access Hong Kong capital markets as trade tensions with the U.S. rise. Why It Matters: China’s EV market is growing with sales increasing 4.4% YoY in the first eleven months of 2020, even with overall passenger vehicle sales falling 7.6% YoY, as per CNBC. Leading China EV makers saw record deliveries in December.

XRP, which is troubled by a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission probe, has recovered 13.4% over 24-hours to trade at $0.34. The cryptocurrency backing the Ripple payment protocol has recovered its fourth spot in the cryptocurrency market with a valuation of $15.37 billion. Why It Matters: Data indicates that even as Bitcoin hits new all-time highs, ""whales — "" as investors holding large amounts of Bitcoin are referred to — are continuing to hold on to the asset. SPAC king and Chairman of Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc SPCE Chamath Palihapitiya earlier on Thursday told CNBC that while he can't pin a timeline, Bitcoin is headed to $100,000, $150,000, and $200,000. With a market valuation of around $760 billion, Bitcoin is now engaged in a battle with Tesla Inc. TSLA and Facebook Inc. FB, which have a market valuation of $773.5 billion and $765.4 billion ahead of Friday's market open, respectively. According to JPMorgan, Bitcoin could hit $146,000 in the long-term. A Citibank analyst in November last year, when Bitcoin traded just below $17,000, gave a much steeper projection of $300,000 — to be hit by the end of 2021. © 2024 Benzinga.com.

151,"Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc SPCE Chairman and SPAC king Chamath Palihapitiya said Thursday that Tesla Inc TSLA stock could double or triple in value from here.  What Happened: The billionaire investor dished out the advice on CNBC’s Halftime show saying he could not understand “why people are so focused on selling things that work.” Palihapitiya described Tesla CEO Elon Musk as a “guy who has consistently been one of the most important entrepreneurs in the world.” He urged investors to get behind Musk, Jeff Bezos, the CEO of Amazon.com, Inc AMZN, and Anthony Noto, the CEO of SoFi.

154,"One of the most common questions traders have about stocks is “Why Is It Moving?” That’s why Benzinga created the Why Is It Moving, or WIIM, feature in Benzinga Pro. WIIMs are a one-sentence description as to why that stock is moving. Here’s why shares of FuelCell, electric vehicle stocks and CureVac are moving. FuelCell FCEL trading higher as the confirmation of Joe Biden as U.S. President and recent Democratic victories in Georgia are seen as very favorable for clean energy sectors. Shares of Tesla TSLA, Workhorse WKHS, Nio NIO and Li Auto LI and Nikola NKLA were trading higher Thursday as the confirmation of Joe Biden as U.S. President and recent Democratic victories in Georgia alleviate some gridlock concerns and raise more stimulus optimism.& Tesla shares are also trading higher after RBC Capital upgraded the stock from Underperform to Sector Perform and raised its price target from $339 to $700 per share. German coronavirus vaccine maker CureVac CVAC said Thursday it has signed a collaboration and services agreement with German chemicals company Bayer BAYRY for the further development, supply and territorial operations of CureVac's CVnCoV. © 2024 Benzinga.com.

155,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited’s (NYSE: TSM) revenues for the fourth quarter of 2020 could be close to NT$361.5 billion (roughly $12.92 billion), claims Bloomberg based on the December sales report. What Happened: Bloomberg’s sales estimates are an indicator of solid demand for Apple Inc’s (NASDAQ: AAPL) 5G iPhones. The company’s management anticipates that the 5G and high-performance computing products would be the key growth drivers over the long-term. Bloomberg Intelligence Analysts Charles Shum and Simon Chan opine that the Taiwanese company’s revenues would beat the $12.7 billion guidance, with regular orders from Apple and Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ: AMD). However, they also hint that additional costs to manufacture the 5-nanometer chips and the Taiwanese currency’s strong performance could weigh on the operating margin. Why Does It Matter: Bloomberg’s estimates come a week before Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co’s scheduled earnings release. The company’s financials are scheduled for release on Jan 14. For the period between October to December 2020, Apple suppliers exhibit strong confidence of beating revenue expectations. Foxconn or Hon Hai Precision Industry Co HNHPF booked higher than expected revenues for that period, and Apple’s U.K. headquartered supplier Dialogue Semiconductor PLC (OTC: DLGNF) has raised sales forecasts. Price Action: TSM shares are up 2.40% at $124.35, hitting a new 52-week high in the pre-market session on the last check Friday. Image Courtesy: Wikimedia © 2024 Benzinga.com.

156,"Small cap Immersion Corporation IMMR is rising as its haptic technology could be added to a second major gaming console after its success with another. What Happened: Immersion has a royalty deal with Sony Corporation SNE. The deal allows the company to use Immersion’s haptic technology in gaming and VR controllers, including the strong selling PlayStation 5. After the success of the PlayStation 5 and the strong reviews for the controller, Sony’s gaming rival Microsoft Corporation MSFT is considering adding haptic technology to controllers. Microsoft sent an Xbox console experience survey to its users that asks questions about the controllers. Questions ask if the Xbox Series X feels next-gen and if users are aware of features on Playstation controllers that they wish were on Xbox controllers, according to TechRadar. “I applaud what they did with the controller. I think for all of us in the industry, we should learn from each other and the innovation that we all push on, whether it’s distribution of business model like Game Pass, or controller tech,” Microsoft Vice President of Gaming Phil Spencer told The Verge. Related Link: Immersion: The Thing Behind The Thing For Playstation 5 Why It’s Important: Xbox has a history of adding well-received features on other console controllers to its own, IGN points out. The gaming publication has called the PlayStation 5 controller one of the most impressive features of the new console from Sony, scoring it a 9 out of 10. “Microsoft’s interest in these questions would suggest that they’re at least thinking about upgrading the next-gen controllers in the future, to line up with Sony’s offering in the current-generation,” writes IGN. Haptic technology could be a major theme for video games going forward as it connects users to the games and makes a more interactive experience. Several 2021 games like “Returnal” and “Deathloop” are taking advantage of the haptic technology of the PS5 controller and making the game more interactive for users. Immersion has hinted throughout 2020 that the new controller for the PlayStation 5 could lead to additional demand for its patents and products. “We believe Sony’s new controller will catalyze increased market demand for advanced interactive haptic experiences and this may lead to additional opportunities for Immersion in the future,” the company said. What’s Next: Immersion is expected to announce fourth-quarter earnings in March. The earnings should provide a better look into the revenue generated from Sony and could provide more color on how much Immersion gets as a royalty for each PlayStation 5 controller sold. Immersion reported revenue of $7.6 million versus street consensus of $7.45 million for the third quarter. The fourth quarter of the last fiscal year was the largest for the company in terms of revenue. Benzinga’s Take: We highlighted Immersion in July and December and mentioned how important the PlayStation 5 inclusion was for the company. The deal with Sony was a major catalyst and adding Microsoft to the fold could be just as valuable. Shares of Immersion closed Thursday up 9.5% to $12.08. Shares were up 46% in the last 52 weeks. © 2024 Benzinga.com. Benzinga does not provide investment advice. All rights reserved.

158,"General Motors GM executives said in a press conference on Wednesday that the company will reveal details of its upcoming electric vehicles at the virtual CES trade show next week. General Motors already announced last year it aims to sell 1 million electric vehicles in 2025. With an investment of $27 billion, GM showed its commitment to fight to become number one in North America. A decade ago, GM was the company to beat in the U.S. in electric vehicles, but Tesla Inc TSLA, which joined the blue-chip S&P 500 last month, has since smashed that record with its Model 3. Although this is just a sliver of the overall U.S. vehicle market, it was enough to turn the 112-year-old GM into an underdog as Tesla has emerged a the dominant player in the U.S. EV market. At a value of $600 billion, Tesla's market capitalization is now 10 times that of GM. Unlike traditional automakers, it is a pure-play electric vehicle company. GM could face future costs if the pollution emitted by internal combustion engines starts being seen as a long-term liability, which would trigger more regulation, legislation and litigation. This is why some investors think the automaker might still spin off its EV business, despite GM's statements to the contrary. On January 5th, Ideanomics (NASDAQ: IDEX) revealed it signed a definitive agreement to acquire WAVE, a leading provider of wireless charging systems for commercial EVs. The fully automated WAVE system eliminates battery range limitations and enables EVs to achieve driving ranges that match that of internal combustion engines. Moreover, WAVE enables electric vehicles to achieve the same driving ranges like that of internal combustion engines. Fast, safe and in-route charging is key to enable the wider adoption of EVs for them to actually have a shot at replacing ICE vehicles. The news of a potential partnership between Hyundai Motor Company HYMTF and Apple Inc AAPL reported by the Korea Economic Daily and confirmed by Hyundai to Bloomberg have sent Hyundai's shares up more than 20% on the Korea Exchange on Friday. Last month, Reuters reported that Apple's car initiative, Project Titan, is on track with plans to develop an autonomous electric passenger vehicle and launch it by 2024. There's no doubt that EVs are the future. The question remains how long it will take for the automotive reality to become all-electric. A Democrat-controlled Senate could pave the way for new EV incentives, boosting EV development in which both traditional automakers and new entrants are investing heavily. As for traditional automakers, they still have a long way to go if they want to pass Tesla in the North American electric vehicle market.  This article is not a press release and is contributed by a verified independent journalist for IAMNewswire.

160,"Michael Burry, who was depicted by Christian Bale in 2015's ""The Big Short,"" said he was shorting Tesla Inc TSLA in December. So far, that bet isn’t going very well to say the least. But Burry took to Twitter to remind his followers that his big bearish bet against the housing market back in 2007 started off poorly as well. Burry is a former hedge fund manager who gained notoriety on Wall Street by predicting and profiting from the subprime mortgage crisis. Related Link: Survivorship Bias May Be Tricking You Into Taking Too Many Investing Risks  Burry’s Bearish Bet: On Dec. 1, Burry tweeted he's shorting Tesla stock. Since that date, the stock is up another 48.3%, but Burry said Thursday he's still convinced the Tesla story will ultimately end poorly. Well, my last Big Short got bigger and Bigger and BIGGER too....$TSLA $60 billion increase in market cap today alone...1 GM, 2 Hersheys, 3 Etsys, 4 Dominos, 10 Vornados...enjoy it while it lasts. pic.twitter.com/T277d4CByO Burry is sticking to his bearish guns in a week that multiple Wall Street Tesla bears have finally thrown in the towel and upgraded the stock. On Thursday, RBC upgraded Tesla from Underperform to Sector Perform and raised its price target from $339 to $700. On Friday, Evercore ISI upgraded Tesla from Underperform to In Line and initiated a $659 price target. Tesla shares are now up 513% in eight months since Tesla’s CEO Elon Musk himself tweeted that “Tesla stock price is too high imo” back on May 1 of last year. Benzinga’s Take: Identifying financial market bubbles is much more difficult than predicting just how inflated they will get and exactly when they will pop. Economist John Maynard Keynes once described this difficulty in his famous quote: “The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.” Tesla's stock trades around $878 at publication time. © 2024 Benzinga.com.

 Financialnewsmedia.com News Commentary Jan 08, 2021, 11:30 ET Share this article PALM BEACH, FL, Jan. 8, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- One of the markets that is actually growing not only during… but because of the global pandemic. Remote working and video conferencing go hand-in-hand in this upswing and both markets are projected significantly increase revenues in the coming years. Remote work, home office, work from home, telework are some of the terms used to describe settings where workers are not physically present in the office of their employer or the purchaser of their services. The concept mainly works for jobs and tasks that involve a large amount of screen work. (including marketing and sales functions).  The advancement of digitalization and the shift to a more knowledge-based economy in many countries have made the option of remote work more realistic for employers and employees. For example, roughly half of all jobs could be done in a remote setting in the United States. A recent report from Statista said that: ""The increasing availability of stable, reliable, and fast fixed and mobile broadband connections, along with the rise of cloud computing, provides the backbone infrastructure for work from home. The steady growth of cloud solutions offers companies and workers alike the flexibility to have access to data and tools from anywhere.""   Active companies in the markets this week include Verb Technology Company, Inc. (NASDAQ: VERB), Zoom Video Communications, Inc.(NASDAQ: ZM), Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: CSCO), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), 8x8, Inc. (NYSE: EGHT).  The Statista Report continued: ""Spending… on cloud-based business applications, collaboration tools, cybersecurity, and remotely managed IT services are projected to grow by almost 100 billion U.S. dollars over the next few years for example. Spending for on-premises solutions is forecast to stay nearly flat on the other hand. Placed on top of the fundamental infrastructure, collaboration and communication tools provide the necessary services to work collaboratively as a team in remote settings. In line with the growth trend of the cloud market, the revenue from the cloud email and collaboration market is set to double in size by 2024 compared to 2020 and is projected to be worth around 81 billion U.S. dollars annually, almost doubling its projected size in 2020.""  Meanwhile in a collaborative market, the video conferencing market, also shows increased revenues. The two-way transmission of audio and video content by using telecommunication devices is referred to as video conferencing.

163,"Tesla Inc TSLA is making its vehicles more price competitive to gain a bigger chunk of the Chinese EV market, if reports are to be believed. What Happened:  Tesla is planning to produce a third EV model from the Shanghai Giga in 2022, with the price point estimated between 160,000 yuan ($24,700) and 200,000 yuan ($31,000), local Chinese media reported. The new car project was initiated in September 2020 and product validation is expected to be completed in March, the report said. Tesla currently sells Model 3 vehicles in China and it has begun accepting orders for made-in-China Model Y vehicles. Related Link: Why Tesla Is Opposing South Korea's Proposed Green Energy Vehicle Policy The new sedan, according to the report, is likely to be a two-seater with a body chassis similar to Model 3.

The model that will reportedly be based on Model 3 chassis to cost ¥ 160K-200K. pic.twitter.com/hfBggv5ct9 Tesla's cheapest car is the China-made Model 3, which is armed with a lithium iron phosphate battery. It's priced around 249,900 yuan ($38,500). Why It's Important:  With the nimble Chinese EV startups such as as Xpeng Inc – ADR XPEV and Nio Inc – ADR NIO breathing down the neck of Tesla, competitive pricing is one way of making deeper inroads into the local market. Nio currently sells at the high-end, while Xpeng caters to the low- and mid-sized market. Speculation is rife that  Nio  may also be looking to enter the low-end market, although the company has not confirmed the same. © 2024 Benzinga.com. Benzinga does not provide investment advice.

Amazon’s successful flywheel business model and Amazon Web Services are well known. However, we believe the current share price under‑appreciates: – The consistency and longevity of Amazon’s growth potential in its key businesses; – The importance of additional revenue streams such as advertising which are high margin and growing rapidly; and – The strengthening barriers to competition and competitive advantages arising from Amazon’s stepped‑up investment in logistics and other infrastructure.” 25 best things to buy on Amazon under $20 (Photo credit: Pixabay) Last month, we published an article revealing that Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) was one of the top 15 online shopping websites in the world in 2020.

169,"In 2020, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) investigated Tesla Inc TSLA over reports of unintended acceleration — supposed times where vehicles would accelerate without the accelerator pedal being used. At the time, Tesla released a statement, saying the allegation was brought on by a short seller. Now, as covered by Tesmanian, NHTSA said it has rejected the petition to review 662,000 Tesla vehicles. The organization claims there is no evidence that vehicles accelerate without user input. ""There is no evidence of any fault in the accelerator pedal assemblies, motor control systems, or brake systems that has contributed to any of the cited incidents,"" according to NHTSA. ""There is no evidence of a design factor contributing to increased likelihood of pedal misapplication."" NHTSA also says there's nothing about the build of a Tesla vehicle that would make it more likely for a driver to press the wrong pedal. This essentially means any accelerations that result in a crash are the fault of the driver. This was seen in Toyota vehicles back in 2007, when it was determined the floor mats had a high probability of causing the accelerator pedal to accidentally be pressed. © 2024 Benzinga.com.

170,"ARK Investment Management CEO Catherine Wood had an impressive 2020 with several of her company’s ETFs among the best performing. One of her best moments for 2021 may have taken place this week with a call from 2018 coming to fruition. What Happened: Wood issued a bullish bet on Tesla Inc TSLA in February 2018, calling for shares to hit $4,000. Taking a five-to-one split in August 2020 into account, shares topped $800 on Thursday, hitting on Wood’s original price target. Wood said the bear case on the shares of Tesla was hitting $600, which would still be a double from the price at the time. “If we’re right, this stock in our models is going to $4,000. If we’re wrong, and all they do is electric, our bear case is $600,” Wood said at the time. Related Link: Skillz Spikes 21% After Cathie Wood Adds The Former SPAC To ETF Why It’s Important: Tesla is a top holding for Wood’s ARK ETFs and has helped the fund place among the best performers. Wood had the highest price target at the time and was questioned for being too bullish on Tesla, but stood behind her high conviction play by continuing to hold shares. At the time the highest price target on Tesla was $500 per share, meaning Wood was twice as high with her target. Even in 2020, analysts and investors try to decide if Tesla is an automotive company or a play on energy and automotive or a technology company. “The future is transportation as a service, software as a service. This is where Tesla is going,” Wood said in 2018. Given the debate today and the valuation for Tesla, it could be that Wood was spot on with this call. What’s Next: Wood became even more bullish in February 2020, issuing a new bull case for Tesla shares to hit $7,000 by 2024. Wood’s split-adjusted target price of $1,400 is based on Tesla seeing gross margins approach 40%, capital efficiency improving through production scale and the evolution of autonomous capabilities and penetration of autonomous taxi service. Wood gives the $1,400 price target a 50% chance of hitting. The bear case of $300 is based on 3.2 million cars sold in 2024 and has a 25% chance of likelihood. The bull case for Tesla from Wood sees shares of Tesla hitting $3,000. TSLA Price Action: Shares of Tesla closed Friday up 7.8% at $880.02. © 2024 Benzinga.com.

Tesla Motors (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk is warning his employees . . .
Tesla stock could get crushed in the coming months.
Go here for details on my #1 EV battery stock for 460% target profits (It’s NOT Tesla).”
A month ago I signed up for his “live” zoom Pre IPO, over 40 min into it I left. Very disappointing.
Now he is talking about this new E.V. battery.
It is my first time posting and wonder if  my friends here could give me any hint on what he is talking about

179,"The Nio ET7 sedan.  Nio Inc – ADR NIO kicked off its Nio Day 2020 event in Chengdu late Saturday local time amid much fanfare. The event was attended by scores of users and Nio fans from across China, and was also livestreamed. The annual event is usually held in December, but this year was held in January for unspecified reasons. In line with  reports  in the run-up to the event, the company unveiled its first-ever sedan, the Nio Power Swap Station 2.0 and the 150-kilowatt-hour battery pack. Curtains Raised On The All-New ET7 Sedan:  Nio's first-ever sedan, named ET7, was launched with a tagline ""Ready For Tomorrow"" by the company's founder, Chairman and CEO William Li. Li described the car as another evolution of Nio's design DNA and a break from convention.  ET7 boasts what Li says is the first UWB digital key, and has soft-closing doors and frameless windows. The car is 5,098 millimeters long, 1,505 millimeters high and 1,987 millimeters wide. It has a wheelbase of 3,060 millimeters. The interior is designed with a ""second living room"" concept. The car comes with Nio's in-vehicle artificial intelligence, NOMI, which provides infotainment and navigation functions.

The NAD has 19 safety and driving-assisted features that can be offered under Autonomous Driving-as-a-Service, or ADaaS. Lower Drag, Higher Efficiency and Longer Range:  On the performance front, Li said ET7 has an ultralow drag coefficient of 0.23. The second-generation, high efficiency, powertrain platform, with SiC power module improves vehicle energy efficiency. The range of the sedan armed with a 70-kWh battery pack is over 500 kilometers, and the range improves to over 700km with a 100-kWh pack and over 1,000km with the newly-unveiled 150kWh pack. The sedan accelerates from zero to 100km/hour in only 3.9 seconds. Pricing: The Standard Edition of ET7 with 70-kWh battery pack is priced at 448,000 yuan ($69,185) before subsidies. Under a Battery-as-a-Service scheme,  the price is 378,000 yuan ($58,375) and a 980-yuan ($140) monthly subscription. For a Standard Edition sedan with a 100kWh-pack, the pricing is 506,000 yuan, while under the BaaS plan, the price is 378,000 yuan plus a monthly subscription fee of 1,480 yuan. The ET7 premium edition with a 100kWh-pack is priced at 526,000 yuan ($78,140). Under the BaaS option, it is 398,000 yuan ($61,460), plus a 1,480-yuan ($230) monthly subscription fee.

182,"Investors mistakenly ran up a stock 1100% during the last two days of the week's trading, after getting ahead of themselves when they saw a tweet from Elon Musk. What Happened: The Tesla Inc TSLA founder and CEO on Thursday tweeted a message of support for the encrypted messaging app Signal, encouraging people to sign up. Later that day, the shares of another company called Signal shot up. That company, Signal Advance, which is traded over-the-counter, saw its shares rise 527% the first day, and then another 91% on Friday. The price went up from 60 cents to $7.19, for a total rise of just under 1100%. The encrypted messaging app Musk tweeted about is not managed by a public company, but a non-profit organization run on donations only. It released a statement on Dec. 8 to clear up the confusion. “It's understandable that people want to invest in Signal's record growth, but this isn't us. We're an independent 501c3 and our only investment is in your privacy,"" the non-profit said. Is this what stock analysts mean when they say that the market is giving mixed Signals?

It's understandable that people want to invest in Signal's record growth, but this isn't us. We're an independent 501c3 and our only investment is in your privacy. pic.twitter.com/9EgMUZiEZf A similar thing happened to Zoom stock on the day it went public. Due to high anticipation for the video conferencing platform going public, traders mistakenly bought shares of a Chinese company called Zoom Technologies Inc ZTNO, instead of the more familiar Zoom Video Communications Inc ZM. The shares of the Chinese company rose by 80% in two hours of trading that day. Why It Matters: The interest toward new messaging apps has risen recently since Facebook Inc FB-owned messenger WhatApp announced it is changing its privacy policy and will be sharing users’ data, including phone numbers, with the parent company. This is a mandatory policy, which all users must agree to by Feb. 8, or they will lose access to the app. © 2024 Benzinga.com. Benzinga does not provide investment advice. All rights reserved.

183,"Conservative social media platform Parler is trending on the App Store, a day after Twitter Inc TWTR banned Donald Trump’s personal account.  What Happened: The platform that describes itself as a ""non-partisan public place” has risen to the No. 1 spot for downloads on Apple Inc’s AAPL App Store, TechCrunch has reported. According to analytics firm Sensor Tower, Parler had around 210,000 installs on Friday, a 281% rise from the day before, when there were 55,000 downloads.  “In the U.S., the app saw approximately 182,000 first-time downloads on 1/8, up 355% from about 40,000 installs on 1/7. Since Wednesday, the app has seen approximately 268,000 installs from across U.S. app stores,” TechCrunch reported, citing the firm’s email. Capitol Backlash: Tech companies are tightening the screws on Trump and right-wing supporters after the riot at Capitol Hill this week. Twitter yesterday permanently banned Donald Trump from its platform “due to the risk of further incitement of violence."" Parler was banned from Google Play yesterday for violating Google’s policies — it allegedly failed to moderate conversations about planning violent protests in D.C. that took place on Wednesday. Apple sent Parler management a letter earlier yesterday asking to present a “moderation improvement plan” within 24 hours or face a ban from the store. It is unclear whether the company has submitted the plan at this time. Rebekah Mercer, a backer of conservative causes, is reportedly an investor in Parler, which has also drawn support from media figures such as Fox Business anchor Maria Bartiromo.

 Your daily productivity can be greatly improved 🚀 if you can automate all the tasks you used to do. Thanks to node, npm, npx and typescript: creating a CLI command and making it available on your system or globally has never been easier. As an example, we will create a CLI command to get a stock value for a symbol. This command will be called pique-sous (as a reference to the Disney character ""Uncle $crooge"" in french 😄 🦆)
 Result:
 The final results in available at https://github.com/raphaelmansuy/pique-sous and published at https://www.npmjs.com/package/pique-sous. This article was originally published at https://www.elitizon.com/ ✅ Create a directory called pique-sous
 ✅ create a file index.ts under pique-sous
 As a result, you should have:
 ✅ Edit the index.ts and add a simple command for testing such as:
 ✅ Execute and test the file with ts-node
 npx is a tool from the NPM registry allowing executing commands without installation
ts-node is a node version supporting typescript directly As a result you should have something like this:
 ✅ Modify the index.ts file such as
 The first line #!/usr/bin/env npx ts-node specifies that the file must be executed by npx and ts-node ✅ Add the executable permission to the index.ts file
 ✅ Test the file
 Results:
 ✅ Add package.json file Inside the directory use the npm command to create a package.json file
 Answer the questions:
 ✅ Configure compilation from typescript to javascript Create a file called tsconfig.json as follow:
 ✅ Create a src directory and move the index.ts in the ./src directory
 Results:
 ✅ Add typescript support for the compilation
 Result:
 The package.json should look like this:
 ✅ Edit the package.json as follow 👉 add ""bin"" entry with value ""bin/index.js""
👉 add ""build"" command in ""scripts""
 ✅ Edit the index.ts as follow 👉 replace npx ts-node by node because the result of the compilation by typescript compiler will be a javascript file
 ✅ Build
 Results:
 The bin directory contains now the outcome of the compilation process:
 ✅ Make ./bin/index.js executable
 ✅ Test the result
 Result:
 🔥 The command can now be made available for use locally:
 Result:
 🎉 💪 We can now use the command from everywhere
 🌈 🙈 We can unregister the command with:
 👉 First, you need to signup and create an account on https://www.npmjs.com/
👉 🧨 You need to be sure that the name of your package is not taken on npmjs.com, the name of the package in the package.json must be modified it the name already exists on npm. Type the following command in the base directory:
 Enter your npm credentials Result:
 Your command is now published on npm and be installed or executed from everywhere. Example: Execution without formal installation:
 Or global installation:
 ✅ Install axios library
 ✅ Add file ./src/getStock.ts
 ✅ Add file ""./src/getVersion.ts""
 ✅ Modify ./src/index.ts
 ✅ Increment the version number in package.json to 1.1.0 (""version"")
 ✅ Build a new version
 ✅ Test locally Publish the component:
 ✅ Execute
 Result:
 🔥🔥🔥 The package can now be republished on npm 💪. Templates let you quickly answer FAQs or store snippets for re-use. The source code is available at github.com/raphaelmansuy/pique-sous The command is available at npmjs.com/package/pique-sous

188,"Nio Chairman and CEO William Li speaks at the Nio Day event in Chengdu, China, on Jan. 9, 2021. Chinese EV startup Nio Inc – ADR NIO  unveiled  its first-ever sedan at the Nio Day event held in Chengdu on Saturday. The company is taking aim at high-end competitors with the technology, performance and user experience features it announced. What Happened:  The premium-priced ET7 sedan is positioned against cars from traditional luxury automakers such as Bayerische Motoren Werke ADR BMWYY and Daimler ADR's DMLRY Mercedez Benz and Audi units, which is majority owned by Volkswagen A G Unsponsored Represent 1 10th Sh ADR VWAGY. That's according to Nio founder, Chairman and CEO William Li, who spoke after the event, as reported by Chinese media outlet Sina.com.cn and in English by  cnTech Post.

Benzinga's Take: Nio's ET7 is billed as a best-in-class sedan, with the only shortcoming being its premium pricing. Given burgeoning demand for EVs in China, Nio's increasing brand recognition and the company's innovative schemes such as Battery-as-a-Service and Autonomous Driving-as-a-Service that reduce costs for customers, the ET7 is likely to see a fairly robust uptake.

192,"Tesla Model Y Tesla Inc TSLA is planning to set up a design studio in China to tailor its electric vehicles to Chinese tastes, Reuters reported. Full Studio: Citing three unnamed people with knowledge of the matter, Reuters said the ""full function"" studio would be in Shanghai or Beijing. The plans are not near finalization yet as the company keeps an eye on U.S.-China tensions. But Tesla has been searching for a director and others to staff the studio, the sources said. Headhunters have been working since September and using LinkedIn as a channel for finding candidates. Strategic Market: China is the second biggest market for Tesla, after the U.S., and the company's Shanghai Gigafactory, opened just over a year ago in late 2019, attests to the importance of the country to the world's biggest electric vehicle maker. Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives has said described EV demand in China as ""white hot,"" and in November the firm predicted that 40% of Tesla sales could come from China by 2022. Orders for the company's Model Y, produced in Shanghai, reportedly ate up the full first quarter's worth of supply within days, just after opening up a web page for orders at the start of the year. Two of the sources in the Reuters exclusive said one possible vehicle the new studio would work on is a $25,000, high-volume car, adding support to other recent reports of such plans and which Tesla CEO Elon Musk has talked about for some time.

Why It Matters: Hyundai refused to comment on the matter and pointed Reuters to an earlier statement which stated it was talking to multiple automakers. Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said Friday that Apple would announce an EV strategic partnership in 2021. The analyst said the Tim Cook-led company could be looking at a handful of strategic partnerships worldwide with existing automakers. Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said last month that segment leader Tesla Inc’s TSLA stock faces a “formidable bear case” due to Apple’s EV plans.

195,"Baidu, Inc BIDU said Sunday it will form an intelligent electric vehicle (EV) company and forge a strategic partnership with Volvo parent Geely Automobile Holdings Limited GELYY. What Happened: The Beijing-based internet firm, best known for its eponymous search engine, said it plans to establish a separate company that will make EVs. Baidu will provide the intelligent driving capabilities to power the EVs for the new venture and the Chinese automaker will pitch in with design and manufacturing expertise. “China has become the world's largest market for EVs, and we are seeing EV consumers demanding next generation vehicles to be more intelligent,” said Robin Li, co-founder and CEO of Baidu. “We believe that by combining Baidu's expertise in smart transportation, connected vehicles and autonomous driving with Geely's expertise as a leading automobile and EV manufacturer, the new partnership will pave the way for future passenger vehicles.” Why It Matters: Baidu is looking to raise $3.5 billion from a secondary listing on the Hong Kong market.  The Chinese internet giant already has its own navigation system app and voice assistant technology called DuerOS and is already working on developing autonomous driving technology. Chinese EV market continues to grow thanks to government support in the form of subsidies and charging infrastructure, according to CNBC. Pure EV sales increased 4.4% from January to November compared with a year earlier even though overall passenger car sales fell 7.6% in the same period, as per China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, as cited by CNBC. The Asian nation has no dearth of emerging EV companies such as Li Auto Inc LI, Xpeng Inc XPEV, and Nio NIO, who all compete for market share against market leader Tesla Inc TSLA, which has a factory in Shanghai.

199,"Financial technology company Stripe Inc will no longer process Trump campaign payments, the Wall Street Journal reported Sunday. What Happened: The San Francisco, California-based company is halting payments processing for the Trump campaign for violating its policies against encouraging violence, people familiar with the matter told the Journal.  Stripe terms state that it does not process payments for “high risk” activities including any business or organization that “engages in, encourages, promotes or celebrates unlawful violence or physical harm to persons or property.” Why It Matters: Last week, outgoing President Donald Trump’s supporters violently stormed the U.S. Capitol. Since the violence, several tech companies issued permanent bans on Trump including Facebook Inc FB and Twitter Inc TWTR.  Several platforms have since then either removed Trump’s accounts or accounts associated with pro-Trump violence, according to Axios. These include Reddit, which has banned the subreddit group “r/DonaldTrump,” Amazon.com, Inc AMZN-owned Twitch, and Shopify Inc SHOP, which has removed two stores affiliated with Trump’s organization and his campaign. Alphabet Inc’s GOOGL GOOG video streaming service YouTube is fast-tracking enforcement against election misinformation.

What Happened: The e-commerce giant had given Parler a 24-hour notice late Saturday, saying it couldn’t “provide services to a customer that is unable to effectively identify and remove content that encourages or incites violence against others,” as reported by TechCrunch. A group of Amazon workers had written to the company, demanding that it stops providing services to Parler. Apple Inc. AAPL and Alphabet Inc.

203,"Tesla Inc TSLA CEO Elon Musk said Monday that he is a benefactor to the messaging app Signal.  What Happened: The entrepreneur said on Twitter early Monday that he had donated to Signal a year ago and he will “donate more.” The free and open-source messaging app saw a surge of users after Musk endorsed it earlier last week in a separate tweet.  Use Signal Musk had taken to Twitter after the attack on the United States Capitol by the supporters of outgoing President Trump and made a thinly veiled attack on social networks, specifically Facebook Inc FB and its CEO Mark Zuckerberg, without directly naming any individual or entity. See Also: Mixed Signals: Elon Musk Tweet About Messaging App Sends People Rushing To Buy Unrelated Stock Why It Matters: Facebook — the owner of the rival messaging app WhatsApp — is also mired in controversy after it unveiled a new privacy policy for the latter, which comes into effect in February, reported the Verge. The privacy policy reportedly no longer provides users the option to opt-out of data sharing with Facebook but instead outlines how WhatsApp will share data with its social networking parent. Data to be shared includes “battery level, signal strength, app version, browser information, mobile network and connection information (including phone number, mobile operator or ISP), language and time zone, IP address, device operations information, and identifiers,"" Forbes reported. The privacy policy changes are aimed at facilitating data sharing between Facebook and WhatsApp and does not effectively change consumer chats, according to a Facebook spokesperson.

211,"GOTHENBURG, SWEDEN - 2019/09/14: An American automotive and energy company that specialises in ... [+] electric car manufacturing Tesla logo seen in Gothenburg. (Photo by Karol Serewis/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Tesla stock (NASDAQ: TSLA) has soared about 8x over the last year, with its market cap approaching $800 billion. Tesla is valued unlike any other automotive stock - at about 200x consensus 2021 earnings, vs about 20x for the broader auto industry. [1] The Tesla investment thesis hinges on a lot more than selling luxury EVs. Investors are counting on Tesla to make fully self-driving cars, launch a fleet of robo taxis, make big improvements to battery tech, and more broadly drive the decarbonization of the auto industry. This story is tied in no small measure to the business acumen and leadership of Tesla’s visionary CEO, Elon Musk. Mr. Musk has already delivered big - changing the perception around EVs with highly desirable vehicles, building factories in record time, and taking big strides in autonomous driving. (Just How Far Ahead Is Tesla In The Self-Driving Race?) But Tesla still has a lot to prove and it will probably be years before the company grows into its lofty valuation. If Mr. Musk, left the scene, for any reason, there’s no question that the story surrounding Tesla stock would change dramatically. The closest parallel to Tesla’s dependence on Mr. Musk would be Apple
AAPL
 and the late Steve Jobs. However, Apple was much larger and more mature when its visionary departed in 2011. Apple’s Revenues stood at about $110 billion in FY’11 and its business model was largely set in stone. Its computing trifecta of the iPhone, iPad, and Mac were well established in their respective categories and the services business, led by the AppStore, was building momentum. Tesla, on the other hand, is still early in the growth cycle and is barely profitable, excluding its regulatory credit sales. (related: How Regulatory Credits Impact Tesla’s Margins) While the fortunes of most other mega-cap companies are also tied to their founders or senior leadership to some measure, there is a fair amount of margin of safety. For example, Facebook (with a market cap of $760 billion) and Google
GOOG
 ($1.2 trillion) have their platforms and network effects that power their ad machines. Apple ($2.2 trillion) investors value its ecosystem that locks customers in and gets them to keep spending on products and services, while Amazon
AMZN
 ($1.6 trillion) investors are buying into a massive physical and cloud-based infrastructure that powers its e-commerce juggernaut. We think Tesla investors, on the other hand, are really paying a premium for the ongoing innovation and future potential which is heavily tied to Mr. Musk. While this risk is obviously hard to quantify, it’s worth noting for shareholders. Want to play the Electric Vehicle market, but think that stocks of EV brands are overvalued? Component suppliers might be a better bet. Check out our theme on Electric Vehicle Component Supplier Stocks for more details. [12/21/2020] Tesla will be added to the S&P 500 index on Monday, December 21. The stock has rallied by about 70% since the announcement of the index inclusion in mid-November and is up a whopping 8x this year, with its current market cap standing at about $660 billion. The Tesla story has appeal - the company is at the forefront of two of the biggest trends in the automotive market - electric vehicles and self-driving software. Tesla has also grown despite the pandemic, driven in part by its Chinese business, and has also posted profits over the last five quarters (although a bulk of the profits still come via the sale of regulatory credits). However, we think the stock is significantly overvalued at current levels. Tesla trades at about 15x projected 2021 Revenue and about 175x projected earnings. There’s little precedent for this sort of a valuation in the highly cyclical and capital intensive auto industry in recent history. In fact, using the industry average P/E of about 15x [2], Tesla would have to post over 2x the profits of the top ten automakers combined to justify its valuation. For perspective, the top ten automakers by sales posted net profits of under $20 billion over the last 12 months. Now with the S&P inclusion likely to bolster Tesla’s position as a blue-chip name, could it still see a correction in the near to medium term? While Tesla stock might see lower volatility post its entry into the index, considering that its shareholder base will skew towards passive investors who won’t be actively trading and potentially managed funds that are benchmarked to the S&P 500, the stock could still get a reality check for a couple of reasons. Firstly, with highly effective vaccines being rolled out things should start getting back to normal, helping the economy. Now even an indication that the U.S. Fed could revisit its stance on ultra-low interest rates could hit valuations for high-growth stocks like Tesla. There are industry-specific risks as well. Mainstream players such as GM and Volkswagen have been doubling down on EV investments. If these players deliver compelling EVs that are well-received with customers, it could change the narrative around the auto majors and potentially hurt the valuation of pure-play EV companies such as Tesla.

Check out our theme on Electric Vehicle Component Supplier Stocks for more details. [11/18/2020] Tesla Will Join S&P 500, What Does This Mean For The Stock? On Monday, S&P Dow Jones indicated that electric vehicle bellwether Tesla would be included in the S&P 500 index, causing the stock to rally by over 8% in Tuesday’s trading. The inclusion is likely to be effective from December 21, although it could occur in two tranches given that Tesla will be the largest company ever added to the index, and among the top 10 companies by market cap on the S&P 500. So what does this mean for Tesla stock and investors? Firstly, the inclusion could drive strong near-term demand for Tesla stock from not just index funds that track the S&P 500 but possibly from managed funds that are benchmarked to the S&P 500. For perspective, S&P Dow Jones estimates, based on recent market cap data, that funds will need to sell other positions to the tune of around $51 billion to buy Tesla stock. [3] Based on Tesla’s current market cap, this likely translates into roughly 11.5% of Tesla’s total shares outstanding and over 13% of Tesla’s free float (publicly held shares that can be traded without restrictions). Secondly, having a large chunk of Tesla stock held by passive index investors could eventually reduce volatility for Tesla, which has been prone to big swings in the past. That said, the index inclusion doesn’t change the fundamental picture for Tesla. The stock appears pricey in our view, trading at about 110x consensus 2021 earnings, compared to about 26x for the broader S&P 500. At these valuations, Tesla will need to execute very well - banking on new launches such as the Model Y, its international expansion, and higher software sales - to justify its stock price. [Updated 7/15/2020] Will Tesla Be On S&P 500? Tesla’s Software Has One Clue   As a leader in autonomous driving, we estimate that Tesla recorded $1.4 billion in Software Revenue in 2019 via sales of its Full Self Driving software upgrades. These upgrades, which cost about $8,000 per vehicle currently, are also highly lucrative. So How Do Tesla’s Software Upgrades Impact Its Margins? We estimate that they contributed about 400 basis points (4%) to Tesla’s Automotive Gross Margins (revenues less direct costs, divided by revenues) of 21% in 2019. Excluding software sales, Tesla is unlikely to have been profitable over the last few quarters. No discussion about S&P inclusion. How Do Software Sales Impact Tesla’s Margins?   Why Software Could Account For A Higher Mix of Margins Going Forward   Trefis What if you’re looking for a more balanced portfolio instead? Here’s a high-quality portfolio to beat the market, with over 110% return since 2016, versus about 60% for the S&P 500.

212,"California-based Intel Corp INTC has reportedly been in talks with Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. TSM and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd SSNLF to outsource partial chip production after delays in its chip fabrication processes, Bloomberg reports. What Happened: Intel had reported problems with its 7-nanometer chip manufacturing process in July 2020 and announced a delay in the rollout of its next-generation chips to 2022, 2023. The company had said it was considering outsourcing some of its chip manufacturing. Intel’s CEO Bob Swan has promised investors that he would set out outsourcing plans by Jan. 21, when it reports earnings. Swan said he would get the company’s production technology back on track. Though Intel is the world’s best-known chipmaker, it has suffered years-long delays that have put it behind competitors that design their own chips and outsource production to companies like Taiwan Semiconductor. Why It Matters: Rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices Inc. AMD and Apple Inc. AAPL have raced ahead with their own designs and TSMC’s advanced production technology, Bloomberg notes. “We have another great lineup of products in 2022, and I’m increasingly confident in the leadership our 2023 products will deliver on either Intel 7-nanometer or external foundry processes, or a combination of both,” Swan said in October 2020.  TSMC is the largest maker of semiconductors for other companies. It has offered to prepare Intel chips manufactured using a 4-nanometer process, with initial testing using an older 5-nanometer process, Bloomberg said, citing people familiar with the matter. TSMC will make 4-nanometer chips test production by the fourth quarter of 2021 and volume shipments by next year.  As Intel keeps manufacturing its best semiconductors in-house, any outsourcing of this scale will require a potential supplier to create new capacity. Samsung is the world’s biggest producer of memory chips and a competitor to TSMC. It has to look for big contracts for its foundry unit, the Financial Times reports. Bernstein analysts estimated Intel might outsource 10-30% of its CPU production in 2023 to TSMC, which would boost the latter’s revenue by 5% to 10%. “Samsung may get a minor share in this business,” but TSMC technology is ahead of Samsung’s “with better execution,” the Bernstein analysts said.  Price Action: On the last check Monday, INTC shares are up 0.90% at $52.11, TSM shares are up by 3.09% at $122.36. © 2024 Benzinga.com.

213,"Mondays might get a bad reputation on Wall Street if they keep starting out like this.  For the second week in a row, stocks begin in a slump. Last week they recovered to hit new record highs by Friday, so there’s that. Rising cases of coronavirus and the swirl of events around President Trump could be contributing to this early weakness. Also, the employment report last Friday didn’t look all that bad when you drill down into it, but over the weekend some analysts were questioning the data and worrying about what it might reflect.  Additionally, there seems to be a bit more of a “risk-off” sentiment taking shape today. Volatility is on the rise, bitcoin is down, and gold is edging higher. Bonds are holding in place, however. With earnings and data a bit thin today and tomorrow, it wouldn’t be too surprising if the market keeps taking its cue from politics. Earnings season ignites later this week, but another big question hanging over Wall Street is whether Congress can push through another stimulus and if any stimulus effort conceivably could get slowed down by the current tension on Capitol Hill.  Major indices continue to be driven partly by comments from senators and President-elect Biden on the prospect of another payment to Americans. Biden is expected to reveal more details of his economic package this week and wants to make it a top priority early on in his administration, media reports say. Any new information is worth watching, though it feels like Wall Street has already built in a lot of the stimulus hopes. There’s also concern that the possible reverberation of last week’s events in Washington might muddy the waters as the new administration tries to gain momentum on stimulus and infrastructure initiatives.  One feature last week was volatility trending down after a spike to begin 2021. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) flirted with 30 a week ago but finished Friday below 22. By early Monday, it was heading back up. Investors still wait to see if VIX can get back below the historic average of 20, which it hasn’t done in almost a year. If you look further out at the VIX futures complex into the February and March timeframe, it’s trading in many cases above 25. So at least a lot of investors don’t expect VIX to calm anytime soon.  Lower volatility last week might have given some investors more confidence to keep “buying the dip,” a trend that took hold last fall and seemed to be the case on just about every pullback the first week of the year. Take Tuesday’s quick recovery from Monday’s drop, and think about how quickly the major indices rebounded Friday after slipping below unchanged around midday. Nothing goes straight up forever, the saying goes. Another saying is “the trend is your friend,” and few seem to be trying to fight the upward trend lately. Those who did probably got bloody noses.  Last week, nothing seemed to move upward more quickly than bitcoin and Tesla Inc TSLA. More on TSLA below, but remember this about bitcoin: Before diving in, make sure you understand the investment. The fundamentals that drive bitcoin are a bit mysterious, so you might want to be cautious if you’re considering trading it. Overall, the first week of 2021 saw decent performance from most of the less “defensive” sectors. Energy, Materials and Financials got out of the gate nicely, though Tech slipped just a bit in what may have been profit-taking after its December rally.  The sectors that underperformed last week included Utilities, Real Estate, and Consumer Staples. In general, Utilities and Staples are places investors tend to park their money when they’re looking for dividend yields. At the same time, the 10-year Treasury yield climbed roughly 20 basis points last week from around 91 to 111. That’s a really significant move that helped Financial stocks and the Russell 2000 (RUT) small-cap index, and is really starting to change the tenor of the market. Rising yields tend to put pressure on dividend-generating stocks because investors who want yields can find them in the fixed income market. However, even at 1.11% the benchmark 10-year remains near historic lows, so it’s early to read too much into this weakness in Utilities and Staples. A couple of individual stocks are on the move ahead of the open. Eli Lilly And Co LLY jumped 15% on news of positive Alzheimer’s trial data. And Chinese electric vehicle maker Nio Inc NIO climbed 11% after it introduced a new model over the weekend.  Looking back one more time at last Friday’s disappointing jobs report, it seems to have been shrugged off by Wall Street because it mostly reflected the impact of shutdowns on the leisure sector. The thinking could be that if vaccinations really get going, a lot of those jobs might come back.  Also, the recent stimulus package passed by Congress didn’t take effect until well after the jobs data got collected, so Washington’s help for small business might have an impact starting this month. Any further stimulus could also have investors thinking December might have been a “one-timer,” to use an old hockey term. We’ll see.  Beyond that, there was actually a bunch of stuff to like about the report, including upward revisions to October and November, along with solid growth in manufacturing, construction, transportation, and business and professional services jobs. The unemployment rate of 6.7% also was unchanged, though that can be a tricky number because it doesn’t reflect people who’ve given up job hunting and left the workforce. In a rapidly growing economy, those people often start venturing back in, and that’s why long-term unemployment remains a key number to watch if and when the virus gets under control. Most of the long-term numbers didn’t change much in December, according to the Labor Department. 
CHART OF THE DAY:  GOLD GOT A HAMMERING. It didn’t take long for gold futures (/GC—candlestick) to lose their shiny luster. After moving in an upward channel (yellow lines) since the end of Nov. 2020, the uptrend looks to have gotten exhausted. Friday’s price action saw /GC gap down below its 1900 support level, closing at $1836 per troy ounce. It’s worth watching gold to see if buyers come back in or if prices continue to fall lower.

Past performance does not guarantee future results.   Did Slumping Jobs Picture Weigh on Retail Sales? One thing to potentially watch is how the negative jobs picture might have affected retail sales in December. That data comes out this Friday morning, and we’ll preview Wall Street’s estimates later this week. A big drop in retail sales can often weigh on sectors most exposed to consumers, especially Consumer Discretionary. While retail sales is a big number to keep an eye on, this week’s calendar looks a little odd because it’s almost completely blank Monday and Tuesday. With the earnings calendar a bit light those two days as well—aside from KB Home KBH expected after the close Tuesday—investors might see a market that’s slightly untethered and more vulnerable than usual to moving on news from outside of the corporate and data world. That doesn’t mean hide under your desk and don’t trade, only to be a little more aware that sudden swings one way or the other could occur.  Once earnings begin, there’s a lot to keep track of. BlackRock, Inc. BLK is expected to report Thursday, and Friday is the big morning this week with JP Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, Citigroup Inc C and Wells Fargo & Co WFC. There’s a lot investors can glean about the economy from watching how the banks did and listening to what their executives have to say, and we’ll be talking more about what to look and listen for as the week proceeds. Stay tuned.  Why $50 Crude Might Not Last: Speaking of commodities, one big development last week was crude hitting $50 a barrel for the first time since February. The question is can it last? Though some analysts say they see $65 in the not too distant future, there’s a good argument why it might not be able to get much higher, and could even fall. If you live in the U.S., you’re not too far from the reason why a crude “supercycle,” at any rate, could face an uphill battle.  Last week’s crude rally was partly due to Saudi Arabia’s surprise plan to cut daily crude production by one million barrels, a move that appeared to reflect growing worries about the virus impact on demand. Here’s the problem for the Saudis, especially if the world economy bounces back more quickly than expected: The U.S. has lots of spare capacity that could quickly come back online, spoiling any effort to keep prices elevated. At the end of 2020, there were just 267 active U.S. oil rigs, according to Baker Hughes, down from 670 a year ago and from a peak above 1,600 in early 2014. No one’s saying all that’s coming back online just because oil hit $50, but a jump toward year-ago rig levels wouldn’t be surprising if prices stay here—which ultimately could drive prices lower once new U.S. crude starts flowing. There’s nothing like $50 oil (near the break-even point for many U.S. drillers, according to the Dallas Federal Reserve) to encourage producers to drill, baby, drill.  A Change in the Market Cap Lineup: If there was one narrative that ruled the Tech space over the last couple years, it’s that the big consumer platforms—Apple Inc AAPL, Microsoft Corporation MSFT, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, Alphabet Inc GOOGL, and Facebook, Inc. FB held the top spots in terms of market capitalization among U.S. firms. Can anyone in America say they don’t touch two or more of these companies’ products and services each day—if not all of them? Probably not.  But last week, Tesla Inc TSLA cracked the top five, knocking FB to the #6 spot after a meteoric rise (recall TSLA was added to the S&P 500 Index last month). As of Friday, TSLA shares are on an 11-day win streak—adding 6.5% Friday alone. But here’s the thing: While they’ve become more ubiquitous in recent years, Tesla vehicles still make up less than 1% of the cars on the road. They’re still among a handful of nameplates (think Ferrari and Porsche) that are still capable of turning heads when they drive down the street. So while TSLA’s recent surge puts it in the top echelon in terms of market cap, among top companies that don’t have a strong foothold in American households, it’s in a class by itself.

214,"Biogen Inc BIIB, which has a fairly solid  neurology-focused pipeline,  announced Monday a collaboration with tech giant Apple Inc AAPL. What Happened:  Cambridge, Massachusetts-based  Biogen  said it has tied up with Apple for a virtual study to investigate the role of the Apple Watch and iPhone in monitoring cognitive performance and screening for a decline in cognitive health, including mild cognitive impairment.  The multiyear observational research study, which will enroll young and aging patients, is scheduled for launch this year.  The study's primary objectives are to develop digital biomarkers to help monitor cognitive performance over time and identify early signs of MCI.

215,"Jim Cramer on Monday morning shared his thoughts on one of the hottest electric vehicle stocks. Cramer On Nio: Cramer spoke on CNBC about the developments from Nio Inc NIO at this weekend’s Nio Day. He said Nio is now the hottest Chinese stock, especially with the downfall of Alibaba Group Holdings BABA. “Baba not hot, Nio is,” Cramer said. He questioned the comparisons between Nio and Tesla Inc TSLA and said there is room for both electric vehicle companies, especially in the Chinese market. If the market goes from 2%-3% to 10% share for electric vehicles, both Tesla and Nio could both benefit significantly, said Cramer: “Plenty of room for both.” Click here to check out Benzinga’s EV Hub for the latest electric vehicles news. The only question for Nio could become valuation at current levels as it has run up ahead of the Nio Day event. “Young people trade like a banshee,” Cramer said, referring to Nio stock. With growth seen for electric vehicles and gasoline cars becoming less of a story, Cramer questioned an upgrade for Exxon Mobil Corp XOM by Morgan Stanley. Cramer said investors are looking for the next Tesla and not worried about investing in traditional automotive companies. “They think they’ve found it in Nio,"" he said.

216,"At the end of 2020, Tesla Inc TSLA shut down its Model S and X production lines. The company occasionally does this for retooling purposes, to make updates to machinery or if new equipment is needed to change something about the way the vehicles are produced. The lines are back online Monday, according to Teslarati. This means Tesla can resume production of the more expensive options in its lineup. Tesla's estimated delivery for a Model S or X ordered now for U.S. delivery is eight to 12 weeks, just in time for the end of the quarter. The exact reason for the shutdown is unknown, but many ideas have been shared. Some speculated that Tesla shut down the lines to allow more work on the Model 3 and Y lines. Tesla aimed to delivery 500,000 vehicles worldwide in 2020, and came short of that goal by a few hundred cars. Another interesting rumor afloat is of a refresh coming to Tesla's more expensive options. Click here to check out Benzinga's EV Hub for the latest electric vehicle news. Benzinga's Take: The Model S and X have remained largely unchanged since their debut. Many fans are eagerly awaiting an updated interior and exterior look for the vehicles. At Tesla's battery day, the company announced the Plaid Model S. It's a vehicle with a zero-to-60 mph time of less than 2 seconds and an updated battery architecture, costing $139,990 or more. Tesla says it will be released by the end of 2021, and with it, many expect an updated look.  Photo courtesy of Tesla. © 2024 Benzinga.com. Benzinga does not provide investment advice.

217,"Tesla Inc. TSLA reported deliveries of 180,750 units for the fourth quarter of 2020, ahead of the Street estimates, and announced an equity distribution agreement to sell common stock worth up to $5 billion through an “at the market” offering program. The Tesla Analyst: John Murphy maintained a Neutral rating for Tesla, while raising the price target from $500 to $900. The Tesla Thesis: The company’s fourth-quarter deliveries took the annual figure close to the target of 500,000 units in 2020, Murphy said. Tesla’s latest capital raise follows “a similar offering in September, both of which were consistent with our thesis that TSLA will utilize its stock to raise capital through low-cost equity offerings in order to accelerate aggressive capacity buildout plans globally and drive units/revenue substantially higher, further cementing its status as the dominant EV automaker,” the analyst wrote in a note. “It is important to recognize that the higher the upward spiral of TSLA’s stock goes, the cheaper capital becomes to fund growth, which is then rewarded by investors with a higher stock price,” he added. TSLA Price Action: Shares of Tesla had declined by 4.8% to $837.36 at the time of publication Monday.

219,"Shares of Chinese electric vehicle startup Nio Inc – ADR NIO were trading solidly higher Monday as investors digest the  breakthrough advancements  the company announced at its Nio Day on Saturday. Milestone Reached:  Thanks to the stock rally following Nio Day, the EV manufacturer hit the milestone of achieving $100 billion in market capitalization in Monday's session. The journey to the $100-billion market cap has been fairly quick. To put it in perspective, it took just two years and four months from the time of Nio's listing to achieve the feat, as opposed to about a decade for its larger American rival Tesla Inc TSLA. Nio is now the third most-valued automaker after Tesla and Toyota Motor Corp TM. The market capitalizations of Tesla and Toyota are around $803 billion and $250 billion, respectively. Nio's trailing 12-month price/sales ratio is 40 compared to 28.50 for Tesla, which makes the Chinese company's shares pricier.  Some on Wall Street  have raised concerns about Nio's valuation, which they see as unsustainable. Rising From The Ashes:  Nio's ADSs, which were listed on the NYSE on Sept. 12, 2018, never really took off and were mostly rangebound until mid-2019.  The stock hit an all-time low of $1.19 in Oct. 2019 amid concerns about its liquidity position. For a company operating in a capital-intensive industry, a cash crunch would raise questions regarding its ability to remain as a going concern. Related Link:  Nio's Li: New ET7 Takes Aim At BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Audi And Maybe Even Apple, But Not Tesla  Nio slowly and steadily embarked on the road to recovery through efforts to rein in costs, build brand awareness, improve service offerings, and make best-in-class vehicles that offer superior performance. The COVID-19 pandemic was only a blip on the radar for the company, as it bounced back strongly from the temporary soft patch it witnessed in the first two months of 2020.  For the full year 2020, Nio delivered 43,728 vehicles, representing 112.6% year-over-year growth. In comparison, Tesla delivered 499,550 vehicles. As of December, Nio has delivered 75,641 vehicles cumulatively. Click  here  to check out Benzinga's EV Hub for the latest electric vehicle news. Strong Momentum Going Forward:  With the newly launched ET7 sedan, Nio's sales momentum is likely to accelerate further. The company's battery-as-a-service and autonomous driving-as-a-service offerings are likely to improve the affordability of the premium-priced sedan. Reacting to the Nio Day announcements, BofA Securities analyst Ming Hsun Lee raised the price target for Nio from $59 to $70 and reiterated a Buy rating on the stock. Advanced product and technology launches will continue to boost Nio's sales volume, the analyst said.  Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said Nio's ET7 is roughly the size of Tesla's Model S, goes aggressively after the Chinese sedan market and could increase the company's total addressable market in the key China market over the next five years. NIO Price Action: At last check, Nio shares were rallying 9% to $64.22. Related Link:  Tesla To Launch $25,000 EV Sedan In China By 2022: Report\ Photo courtesy of Nio. © 2024 Benzinga.com.

227,"Tesla Inc TSLA occasionally has themed events in which the company reveals details on its progress and plans for the future. In 2019, Tesla held an autonomy day where the company talked about its progress on Full Self-Driving and first detailed its plans for a driverless robotaxi service. In September 2020, Tesla held a battery day. CEO Elon Musk and others at the company talked about Tesla's future battery technology, the new 4680 battery cells and Tesla's plans to reduce battery costs by up to 50%. Tesla's stock is up about 92% since battery day. Now Musk has teased Tesla AI day on Twitter. This came in response to a fan asking about the capabilities of Tesla's Dojo supercomputer, a computer expected to help train Tesla's self driving software. If Dojo is as powerful as Tesla expects, it will be one of the most powerful computers in the world.  Maybe a Tesla AI day later this year Benzinga's Take: It's unclear what information would be shared at the event. Musk expects Tesla vehicles to reach level five self driving in 2021. If this occurs, it would mean a Tesla could drive from point A to point B without a human in the car. Much remains unknown about Tesla's upcoming Dojo supercomputer.  Click here to check out Benzinga's EV Hub for the latest electric vehicle news. Photo courtesy of Tesla. © 2024 Benzinga.com.

234,"Tech stocks are poised to outperform yet again as the industry sees accelerating growth, according to an analyst at BofA Securities. Factors Favoring The Outperformance:  The semiconductor industry will see an accelerating compounded annual growth rate of 8% from the calendar year 2020 through 2022, compared to the 2% growth of the past three years, analyst Vivek Arya said in a note. Looking ahead, global GDP growth is set to accelerate to 5.4% in 2021, marking the highest growth rate since 1973, BofA estimates. Inventory levels are lean, Arya said. The industry is also likely to benefit from enhanced investments in 5G, as phone units increase to double that of the previous year, the analyst said. Arya also sees secular tailwinds from cloud, AI gaming, IoT and digitization of the global economy. ""While COVID-19 recovery could be uneven and rising rates impact trading multiples, we expect greater investor interest in semis as a source of high-quality alpha generation,"" Arya wrote in the note. Top Investment Themes:  Infrastructure investments, 5G, automobiles and cloud are the four major investments in 2021, BofA said. The firm named Applied Materials, Inc. AMAT as its top large-cap pick and II-VI, Inc. IIVI as the top SMID-cap pick. Chip Infrastructure Players:  Among these themes, semiconductor capital equipment is the most favored, BofA said. Premised on memory price recovery, rising capital intensity, 5G, reshoring and cloud, the firm raised its 2021 fab equipment growth forecast from 8% previously to 10%. The top large-cap designation for  Applied Materials is premised on compelling valuation, share gains, diverse exposure and Kokusai share gains, the firm said. The firm also raised the price target from $105 to a street-high $115. The firm increased the price target for Lam Research Corp. LRCX from $555 to $590 and that for KLA Corp. KLAC from $300 to $315. BofA upgraded Teradyne, Inc. TER shares from Neutral to Buy and increased the price target from $125 to $150. Teradyne, a testing leader in a duopoly market, is uniquely positioned to capture Apple Inc.'s AAPL rising internal semi design, and benefit from recovery in industrial/autos/robotics demand, BofA added. Related Link:  Mizuho's Top Semiconductor Stocks For 2021: Do You Own Them?  Auto/EV, Industrial Sector Levered Chip Stocks: 
NXP Semiconductors NV NXPI is BofA's top pick to benefit from the theme, given that it is most levered to autos, Arya said. The firm will also benefit from IoT recovery, a compelling valuation, new iPhone content and potential S&P 500 inclusion, he added. Arya raised the price target from $190 to $205. Arya also said he likes Microchip Technology Inc. MCHP, Analog Devices, Inc. ADI and Texas Instruments Incorporated TXN. II-VI, which is BofA's mid-cap pick, has underappreciated assets in Gallium Nitride and Silicon Carbide for a wide range of auto/EV and industrial markets, Arya said. The valuation of the stock is also attractive, he added. BofA double upgraded MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings Inc. MTSI from Sell to Buy, premised on its innovative compound semiconductor vendor with attractive restructuring potential, and increased the price target to $70. ON Semiconductor Corp.'s ON stock price appreciation reflects most of the turnaround prospects, BofA said. 5G Plays: With 5G infrastructure investment gathering momentum, Marvell Technology Group Ltd. MRVL is BofA's favored investment, Arya said. In 5G smartphones, BofA likes Qorvo Inc. QRVO and Cirrus Logic, Inc. CRUS. On the other hand, the firm downgraded Skyworks Solutions Inc. SWKS shares from Buy to Neutral, since its 56% Apple exposure leaves it vulnerable to share shifts to Broadcom Inc. AVGO and QUALCOMM, Inc. QCOM. Cloud Growth Continues:  Arya said he continues to like NVIDIA Corporation NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD. However, enhanced market rotation volatility is expected, he added. The analyst maintained an Underperform rating on Intel Corporation INTC. © 2024 Benzinga.com. Benzinga does not provide investment advice. All rights reserved.

235,"Tesla Inc’s TSLA Model Y electric vehicle will help boost sales and emerge as a major disrupter of that country’s auto market in 2021, analysts are estimating, as reported by Reuters on Monday. What Happened: China — the world’s largest car market — saw the launch of the locally made Model Y sports utility vehicles this month for a price of RMB 339,900 ($52,376), which is less than a tenth of gasoline-powered luxury cars with a similar market positioning made by Daimler AG DDAIF, Bayerische Motoren Werke AG BMWYY, and Volkswagen AG VWAGY, according to Reuters. “The pricing will disrupt the conventional premium cars market and shatter the traditional belief that the cost of an electric vehicle (EV) should be higher,” Cui Dongshu, secretary-general of China Passenger Car Association (CPCA) told Reuters. See Also: Tesla To Launch $25,000 EV Sedan In China By 2022: Report Tesla’s Model 3 sedan, which is made in Shanghai, outsold similarly positioned cars made by the luxury automakers in November, as per CPCA data. Why It Matters: Tesla’s Model Y pricing would set a benchmark for automakers to beat and push demand higher, noted Reuters. The ongoing pandemic upended New Energy Vehicle (NEV) sales, which are said to have risen 8% in 2020 to 1.3 million — behind the Chinese government’s annual sales target of 2 million. China Association of Automobile Manufacturers and other analysts project that the sales of NEV — that include battery-electric, plug-in hybrid, and hydrogen fuel-cell cars — to grow 30-40% to near 1.8 million units this year. The government’s extension of EV subsidies by two years will also drive demand this year as Beijing wants NEVs to make up 20% of auto sales by 2025 instead of the current 5%, as per Reuters. Nio Rivalry: Tesla, other foreign players, along with domestic competitors such as Nio Inc NIO, Xpeng Inc XPEV are ramping up production to meet the projected demand. Nio unveiled its first sedan, the et7, during the Nio Day event on Saturday. The company's CEO William Li said this week that the automaker could make cheaper mass-market cars under a different brand. Li clarified that the EV maker doesn't see its new sedan to be in direct competition with Tesla, but according to Automobility Ltd. CEO Bill Russo, Nio is well-positioned to capture a sizeable chunk of the Chinese EV market. The et7 pricing being ""quite competitive with the Model S"" of Tesla is a ""statement of aspiration"" on the automaker's part, Russo told CNBC on Monday. Price Action: Tesla shares closed nearly 7.8% lower at $811.19 on Monday and gained 0.9% in the after-hours session.

236,"Bitcoin (BTC) proponents are calling the drubbing the apex cryptocurrency received over the last two days as “necessary” and “healthy.” No Pain, No Gain: The CEO of Binance, Changpeng Zhao, seemed to take inspiration from the old adage — No Pain, No Gain. Retraces are painful, but they are necessary for establishing support levels. Now we have it. Retrace Opportunities: Barry Silbert, the CEO of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust GBTC parent the Digital Currency Group revised his retrace level to $30,000 and called it a “buying opportunity of a lifetime” in a tweet.  REVISED

Funny to think that a bitcoin price retrace to $30,000 would feel like the buying opportunity of a lifetime https://t.co/ramTbBns4E Weak Hands, Strong Hands: Anthony Pompliano, co-founder of Morgan Creek Digital said on Twitter that “Bitcoin moved from weak hands to strong hands today.” In September, Pompliano appeared with CNBC host Jim Cramer on a podcast, after which the latter purchased $14,000 worth of the cryptocurrency when it was trading at $10,000. Learn About Hedges: Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban termed cryptocurrency trade akin to the dot-com bubble in a tweet and said Bitcoin, Ethereum, and few others will emerge as survivors and thrive like Amazon.com Inc. AMZN and eBay Inc. EBAY. Cuban’s advice — “Learn how to hedge.” HODL On To Your Coins: Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky says there are more corrections to come and a potential for a plunge to $16,000 levels before the end of the first quarter exists. “This process will flush the weak hands and transfer the baton with all their BTC from the short-term speculators to the long-term institutions and HODLers,” Mashinsky told Cointelegraph. Hodlers are persons who refrain from selling their coins in Bitcoin parlance. Measured Gains: Founder of MicroStrategy Incorporated MSTR, Michael Saylor, whose company has purchased over a billion-dollar worth of Bitcoins in the recent past referenced Bitcoin’s prior gains in a tweet.  Today confirms that #Bitcoin will probably not go up at the rate of 1500% per year for more than a month at a time.

Bitcoin has recovered 4.35% in the 24-hours leading to press-time at $36,280, with a market dominance of 68.5%. Ethereum (ETH), the world's second-largest cryptocurrency, is up 4.29% at $1,140.

238,"Video-sharing site Rumble Inc. has filed a lawsuit against Alphabet Inc’s GOOG (GOOGL) Google, accusing it of abusing its search engine power to stifle rivals, the Wall Street Journal reports. What Happened: Toronto-based Rumble, which has shot up in popularity among conservatives recently, alleged Google of anticompetitive conduct, arguing that it is “unfairly rigging its search algorithms” to place YouTube over Rumble in its search results, as per WSJ.  The lawsuit also states that Google’s deal to pre-install YouTube on Android devices has unfairly deprived Rumble of viewers. “Google, through its search engine, was able to wrongfully divert massive traffic to YouTube, depriving Rumble of the additional traffic, users, uploads, brand awareness, and the revenue it would have otherwise received,” the company claims. As per Rumble’s calculation, the missed advertising and views could have generated more than $2 billion in revenue since 2014. A Google spokeswoman told WSJ that it would defend against Rumble’s “baseless claims.” Why It Matters: Google is already facing different lawsuits for antitrust conduct. Apart from the Department of Justice lawsuit filed in October, a bipartisan coalition of states has also sued the search engine giant over antitrust practices related to its online search dominance. Rumble has emerged as a conservative alternative to YouTube and has seen rising popularity as right-leaning voices accuse big-tech like Facebook, Inc FB and Twitter Inc TWTR suppress conservative views. Last week, Amazon.com, Inc AMZN blocked the right-leaning social media platform Parler from its cloud-hosting service Amazon Web Services over not being able to “effectively identify and remove content that encourages or incites violence.” Price Action: GOOG shares closed 2.24% lower at $1,766.72 on Monday.

239,"Tesla Inc TSLA CEO Elon Musk sent Signal downloads soaring as he advocated for the messaging app last week. The app was installed 7.5 million times on Apple Inc AAPL and Alphabet Inc’s GOOGL GOOG Android app stores between Jan. 6 and Jan. 10, according to Sensor Tower data reported by CNBC. See Also: How To Buy Tesla Stock Signal monthly installs have hit their lifetime high, but what exactly is the app and what sets its apart from rivals such as Facebook Inc’s FB WhatsApp — which is under fire after it revised its privacy policy? What Is Signal: Signal is a messaging app that offers services on mobile phones and desktops. The app allows users to make video or voice calls along with texting. All the communications are end-to-end encrypted, which means even Signal cannot see the contents of these chats and calls. The only information that Signal collects from its users is a phone number, which means it has limited data to hand over to law enforcement authorities. You can make an app used by many millions of people that has no data...Cool chart by @forbes & @UKZak  https://t.co/gWFqyIeoZ3 pic.twitter.com/Unngddaq5M Shares Some Pedigree With WhatsApp: Signal is a non-profit organization, which was created by a $50 million grant from WhatsApp’s founder Brian Acton. Acton left WhatsApp after Facebook acquired it in 2014 for $19 billion in cash and stock, as per Reuters. Privacy Focused: When Acton and co-founder Matthew Rosenfeld announced the launch of Signal, the latter said in a message that its mission was to “develop open source privacy technology that protects free expression and enables secure global communication.” “Our plan is to pioneer a new model of technology nonprofit focused on privacy and data protection for everyone, everywhere,” wrote Acton. A Different Revenue Model: Signal’s non-profit model means it depends on grants and private investors for its survival. This week, Musk revealed that he had given such a grant a year ago and pledged to “donate more.” Why The Controversy: WhatsApp recently unveiled a new privacy policy, which will come into effect in February. The privacy policy allegedly eliminates the choice to opt-out of data-sharing with WhatsApp parent Facebook.  We continue to shatter traffic records and add capacity as more and more people come to terms with how much they dislike Facebook's new terms. If you weren't able to create a new group recently, please try again. New servers are ready to serve you. Forbes reported that the data to be share includes everything from battery level and browser information to the user’s IP address. Facebook has since then been at pains to explain that the policy changes are to facilitate data sharing between WhatsApp and itself and does not affect consumer chats. We want to address some rumors and be 100% clear we continue to protect your private messages with end-to-end encryption. pic.twitter.com/6qDnzQ98MP Benzinga’s Take: Facebook has basically shot itself in the foot at a time when the role of tech giants is under immense scrutiny. The Mark Zuckerberg-led tech giant has been explaining to users that the policy applies to business messaging, but it is the coupling of messaging and commerce that is now in the eye of the storm, as people realize their messaging platforms should afford them complete peace of mind as far as privacy is concerned. Zuckerberg & Co’s privacy policy missteps are in essence for privacy-focused standalone messaging apps like Signal, or Telegram, but are unlikely to shake the domination of Facebook-owned platforms anytime soon. © 2024 Benzinga.com.

242,"Big tech continues to take measures to deter further unrest after the Capitol Hill violence last week. Amazon.com, Inc AMZN said that it is removing some products related to the QAnon conspiracy theory, the Wall Street Journal reports. What Happened: Following Capitol Hill’s violence, big tech has moved to ban outgoing President Donald Trump from using their platform.  Followers of the fringe QAnon conspiracy believe Mr. Trump is under assault by Satan worshipers. WSJ notes that some QAnon conspiracy theory followers were among those who stormed Capitol Hill and have been labeled by the Federal Bureau of Investigation as a domestic terrorist threat.  As per WSJ, Amazon’s action to remove QAnon related products like T-shirts, books, and hats follows their action to block the right-leaning social media platform Parler from its cloud-hosting service Amazon Web Services over not being able to “effectively identify and remove content that encourages or incites violence.” Why It Matters: Twitter Inc TWTR said it had removed more than 70,000 accounts since Friday that spread the QAnon conspiracy theory. “We’ve been clear that we will take strong enforcement action on behavior that has the potential to lead to offline harm,” the company said in a blog post. “We began permanently suspending thousands of accounts that were primarily dedicated to sharing QAnon content on Friday afternoon,” the microblogging website added. According to WSJ, Amazon is still selling merchandise related to the president, but Shopify Inc SHOP took down stores run by the Trump Organization and Trump Campaign. Facebook, Inc FB is removing all content mentioning “stop the steal,” a phrase popular among supporters of Trump’s unproven election fraud claims. Price Action: In the pre-market session Tuesday, AMZN shares are up 0.39% at $3,126.50, and TWTR shares are up 1.39% at $48.85.

248,"U.S. stock futures are pointing to a higher open Tuesday as investors hope for any announcements of future economic stimulus ahead of President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration on Jan. 20. That comes as COVID-19 continues to spread. In the U.S., cases topped 22 million Monday while global cases rose above 90 million. Stocks fell Monday, breaking a 2021 winning streak for the major U.S. equity indices except the Nasdaq-100 (NDX). The NDX ended the session with the most losses, down 1.55%, followed by the S&P 500 (SPX) which fell 0.66%. The Dow Industrials ($DJI) fell by 0.29%, while the small-cap Russell 2000 index (RUT) closed only 0.03% lower. Bank stocks outperformed ahead of Friday when a number are set to report fourth-quarter earnings. Other winners Monday included stocks more sensitive to economic growth, like retailers and certain small-caps. The benchmark 10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield also made gains: the TNX hit its highest level since March 19, 2020. Big tech weighed on markets.

259,"Every week, Benzinga conducts a sentiment survey to find out what traders are most excited about, interested in or thinking about as they manage and build their personal portfolios. We surveyed a group of over 500 investors on whether shares of Micron Technology MU will reach $200 by 2022. Micron historically focused on providing DRAM for PCs and servers. The firm then expanded into the NAND flash memory market. The company increased its DRAM scale with the purchase of Elpida (completed in mid-2013) and Inotera (completed in December 2016). The company’s top competitors within the computer memory space include Advanced Micro Devices, Inc AMD, Nvidia Corporation NVDA and Intel Corporation INTC. The Idaho-based computer memory and data storage producer continues to garner investor attention given its marked earnings growth. In the company's first-quarter earnings report, earnings rose 62.5% over the past year to 78 cents per share, which beat the estimate by seven cents. Revenue of $5.77 billion rose by 12.23% from the same period last year, which beat the estimate of $5.73 billion. Micron trades around $79.45 at the time of publishing, off the 52-week low of $31, and 60% of Benzinga traders said Micron would indeed reach $200 per share by 2022. Respondents to the survey said the stock will increase over the next year given the increased demand for and sales of the company’s memory product solutions for the cloud server, enterprise, client, graphics and networking markets. Respondents emphasized Micron’s ultra-bandwidth solutions, which are known to deliver maximum bandwidth to feed client’s data-hungry workloads like high-performance computing, artificial intelligence systems and professional visualization workstations, will continue to spike in demand amid a transition to long-term remote working conditions. This survey was conducted by Benzinga in January 2021 and included the responses of a diverse population of adults 18 or older. Opting into the survey was completely voluntary, with no incentives offered to potential respondents. The study reflects results from over 500 adults.

265,"Apple Inc AAPL and California-based electric startup Canoo Inc GOEV held talks in the first half of 2020 centered around the latter’s speculated automotive entry, the Verge reported Tuesday. What Happened: The companies are said to have discussed options spanning from acquisition to investment, two people familiar with the matter told the Verge. The automotive startup was more interested in securing an investment from Apple, as per the Verge’s sources. The talks have since then fallen through. Canoo shares surged over 25% in after-hours trading. Why It Matters: Canoo’s EV platform dubbed “skateboard” evoked the interest of the Cupertino, California-based tech giant as it integrates more of the car’s electronics and allows for greater flexibility in cabin design, the Verge noted. The platform reportedly also has steer-by-wire technology, which has not been adopted en masse by the industry.  Canoo merged with the blank-check company Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. IV last month to go public.  See Also: Canoo Unveils Multi-Purpose Electric Delivery Vehicle Ahead Of SPAC Merger Plan Apple and Korea’s Hyundai Motor Company HYMTF could sign a deal to produce EVs as early as March, as per unconfirmed reports.  Price Action: Apple shares closed 0.14% lower at $128.80 on Tuesday and gained 0.33% in the after-hours session. On the same day, Canoo shares closed nearly 1.9% lower at $16.72 and gained 25.30% in the after-hours session.

266,"Alphabet Inc. GOOGL GOOG subsidiary YouTube announced late Tuesday it has banned outgoing President Donald Trump’s account from uploading new content for a period of seven days. What Happened: The video-streaming platform also said it had deleted some new content posted by Trump’s account for violating its policies. YouTube said it took the decision “in light of concerns about the ongoing potential for violence” and described its action as first strike. The company added that “given the ongoing concerns about violence, we will also be indefinitely disabling comments on President Trump’s channel, as we’ve done to other channels where there are safety concerns found in the comments section.” Why It Matters: YouTube’s action comes in the aftermath of Trump’s supporters rioting at Capitol Hill last week. A string of social media platforms including Twitter Inc. TWTR, Facebook Inc. FB, and Snap Inc. SNAP moved to take action against the outgoing president.

267,"Tesla Inc TSLA is on its way to becoming a $2 trillion company, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said on Tuesday. What Happened: Ives told Oliver Renick of TD Ameritrade Network in an interview that the Elon Musk-led company was not an auto company but rather a disruptive technology company. See Also: How To Buy Tesla Stock “In a year or two from now, we’re not just looking at one trillion for Tesla, but in a couple of years this could be a company that could start to approach 1.5 trillion - 2 trillion [market valuation].” Ives said that between Tesla and Nio Inc NIO, the former had the lead in the growing Chinese market. “It speaks to what [Elon Musk] has been able to accomplish — being the only U.S. manufacturer without a partner in China.” “It’s a big enough ocean for more than one boat,” the analyst said — referencing the size of China’s EV market which can accommodate firms like Xpeng Inc XPEV, Nio, and others. Ives termed Tesla’s Gigafactory 3 factor as “the key to success” and a “lynchpin.”  Why It Matters: The Wedbush analyst said that Tesla’s profitability is underestimated as it could sell up to 800,000 units this year. The analyst also pointed to the incoming U.S. administration of Joe Biden as a “part of the optimism,” due to its “green agenda” and a complimentary “blue Senate.” See Also:  Why 'SPAC King' Palihapaitiya Is Warning Against Selling Tesla Stock The political developments in the U.S. are “bullish for EVs” and bullish for Tesla, General Motors Company GM, Fisker Inc FSR, and others, as per Ives. The analyst repeated his $1,000 bull case price target for Tesla in the interview. Price Action: Tesla shares closed nearly 4.7% higher at $849.44 on Tuesday and gained 0.3% in the after-hours session.

270,"Every week, Benzinga conducts a sentiment survey to find out what traders are most excited about, interested in or thinking about as they manage and build their personal portfolios. We surveyed a group of over 500 investors on whether shares of General Motors Company GM will reach $75 by 2022. General Motors operates under four segments in 2021: GM North America, GM International, Cruise and GM Financial. The United States has four car brands: Chevrolet, Buick, GMC and Cadillac. GM remains the market leader in the U.S. with roughly 17% of the automotive market share in 2020. On Dec. 8 Cruise, the autonomous vehicle company that’s majority-owned by GM, set in motion testing across the city of San Francisco without any human monitors as passengers. Dan Amman, CEO of Cruise, said this represented a significant milestone in the race for autonomous vehicle technology to hit American roads and helps solidify GM’s positioning in leading the American automotive industry in autonomous tech. In a series of updates from CES 2021: GM unveiled a new business called BrightDrop and announced plans to spinoff this delivery and logistics portion of the business. GM also revealed a new electric pallet called EP1 and electric light commercial vehicle called EV600 are both expected later in 2021. Both use GM’s Ultium platform and feature DC fast charging capabilities. See Also: How To Buy GM Stock. Overall, 61% of traders and investors believe shares of GM will reach $75 over the next year. The stock trades around $48 at publication time. Respondents who contributed to our study first and foremost discussed GM’s plan to become a viable competitor in the EV race. Reader sentiment suggests GM could prove to be a value play method to invest in EV stocks, in the sense that the firm hasn’t yet fully been embraced by EV investors. Many who participated in our survey also noted U.S. automakers, in general, face an uphill battle as companies look to keep up with rapidly advancing technological trends and recover amid the pandemic. It can be said car manufacturing must be positioned in the EV market these days. Like GM, Ford Motor Company F is also working on a plan for its exposure to the EV market. A more clear vision for GM will definitely boost trust in the stock’s future. See Also: How To Buy Ford Stock As our team of analysts covered throughout 2020, the growing demand for EVs isn't surprising.

 Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives just made the bull versus bear debate on Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) even more one-sided.  In an interview with TD Ameritrade Network, Ives said the electric vehicle (EV) maker is on its way to becoming a $2 trillion company. “In a year or two from now, we are not just looking at one trillion [$ market cap] for Tesla, but in a couple of years this could be a company that could start to approach 1.5 trillion to 2 trillion.” Ives also said that between Tesla and Shanghai-based EV Nio Inc (NIO), the former — seen by many as the most important innovator of the 21st century — had the lead in the Chinese market which is the world’s largest one. In fact, there were 1.2 million EVs sold in 2019 in China with the counry’s EV market share expected to jump by up to 14% by 2022, according to a recent McKinsey & Co. report.  “It speaks to what [Tesla CEO Elon Musk] has been able to accomplish — being the only U.S. manufacturer without a partner in China,” the analyst said, noting that the size of China’s EV market is big enough to accommodate firms like Xpeng Inc (XPEV), Nio, and others. “It’s a big enough ocean for more than one boat,” the analyst added.  Ives, who repeated his $1,000 TSLA price target in the interview, also termed the combination of China’s strong EV demand with the production uplift from Tesla’s Gigafactory 3 as “the key to success” and a “lynchpin.”  It’s projected that EVs will reach global ubiquity within the next 15 to 20 years. According to ARK Invest’s Cathie Wood,  Tesla is way ahead of everyone else when it comes to making the best EVs given the Elon Musk-led company is not only a car company but also a robotics, an energy storage and an artificial intelligence company. As of writing, Tesla traded 2.74% lower at $846.70. Tesla’s share price has nearly doubled over the past three months, giving it a market valuation of $805 billion.  h/t  Benzinga Disclaimer: This page contains affiliate links.

275,"GOTHENBURG, SWEDEN - 2019/09/14: An American automotive and energy company that specialises in ... [+] electric car manufacturing Tesla logo seen in Gothenburg. (Photo by Karol Serewis/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Tesla stock (NASDAQ: TSLA) has rallied by over 11% over the last 5 trading days and by a solid 23% over the last 10 trading days, driven by strong Q4 vehicle deliveries, which helped the company largely meet its target of selling 500k cars for 2020, and also due to a change in stance by a notable long-time Tesla bear. In comparison, the broader S&P 500 returned less than 3% over the last 5 trading days. Now, is Tesla stock poised to rise further? Although we believe the company remains fundamentally overvalued, trading at about 200x consensus 2021 earnings, Tesla has momentum on its side, and there could be more room for gains in the stock. Specifically, there is a 69% chance of a rise in Tesla stock over the next month (21 trading days) based on our machine learning analysis of trends in the stock price over the last 5 years. See our analysis on Tesla Stock Chances of Rise for more details. Curious about the possibility of rising over the next quarter? Check out the Tesla Stock AI Dashboard: Chances Of Rise And Fall for a variety of scenarios on how Tesla stock could move. [1/8/2021] Tesla Too Dependent On Elon Musk? Tesla stock has soared about 8x over the last year, with its market cap approaching $800 billion. Tesla is valued unlike any other automotive stock - at about 200x consensus 2021 earnings, vs about 20x for the broader auto industry. [1] The Tesla investment thesis hinges on a lot more than selling luxury EVs. Investors are counting on Tesla to make fully self-driving cars, launch a fleet of robo taxis, make big improvements to battery tech, and more broadly drive the decarbonization of the auto industry. This story is tied in no small measure to the business acumen and leadership of Tesla’s visionary CEO, Elon Musk. Mr. Musk has already delivered big - changing the perception around EVs with highly desirable vehicles, building factories in record time, and taking big strides in autonomous driving. (Just How Far Ahead Is Tesla In The Self-Driving Race?) But Tesla still has a lot to prove and it will probably be years before the company grows into its lofty valuation. If Mr. Musk, left the scene, for any reason, there’s no question that the story surrounding Tesla stock would change dramatically. The closest parallel to Tesla’s dependence on Mr. Musk would be Apple

 and the late Steve Jobs. However, Apple was much larger and more mature when its visionary departed in 2011. Apple’s Revenues stood at about $110 billion in FY’11 and its business model was largely set in stone. Its computing trifecta of the iPhone, iPad, and Mac were well established in their respective categories and the services business, led by the AppStore, was building momentum. Tesla, on the other hand, is still early in the growth cycle and is barely profitable, excluding its regulatory credit sales. (related: How Regulatory Credits Impact Tesla’s Margins) While the fortunes of most other mega-cap companies are also tied to their founders or senior leadership to some measure, there is a fair amount of margin of safety. For example, Facebook (with a market cap of $760 billion) and Google
GOOG
 ($1.2 trillion) have their platforms and network effects that power their ad machines. Apple ($2.2 trillion) investors value its ecosystem that locks customers in and gets them to keep spending on products and services, while Amazon
AMZN
 ($1.6 trillion) investors are buying into a massive physical and cloud-based infrastructure that powers its e-commerce juggernaut. We think Tesla investors, on the other hand, are really paying a premium for the ongoing innovation and future potential which is heavily tied to Mr. Musk. While this risk is obviously hard to quantify, it’s worth noting for shareholders. Want to play the Electric Vehicle market, but think that stocks of EV brands are overvalued? Component suppliers might be a better bet. Check out our theme on Electric Vehicle Component Supplier Stocks for more details. [12/21/2020] Tesla will be added to the S&P 500 index on Monday, December 21. The stock has rallied by about 70% since the announcement of the index inclusion in mid-November and is up a whopping 8x this year, with its current market cap standing at about $660 billion. The Tesla story has appeal - the company is at the forefront of two of the biggest trends in the automotive market - electric vehicles and self-driving software. Tesla has also grown despite the pandemic, driven in part by its Chinese business, and has also posted profits over the last five quarters (although a bulk of the profits still come via the sale of regulatory credits). However, we think the stock is significantly overvalued at current levels. Tesla trades at about 15x projected 2021 Revenue and about 175x projected earnings. There’s little precedent for this sort of a valuation in the highly cyclical and capital intensive auto industry in recent history. In fact, using the industry average P/E of about 15x [2], Tesla would have to post over 2x the profits of the top ten automakers combined to justify its valuation. For perspective, the top ten automakers by sales posted net profits of under $20 billion over the last 12 months. Now with the S&P inclusion likely to bolster Tesla’s position as a blue-chip name, could it still see a correction in the near to medium term? While Tesla stock might see lower volatility post its entry into the index, considering that its shareholder base will skew towards passive investors who won’t be actively trading and potentially managed funds that are benchmarked to the S&P 500, the stock could still get a reality check for a couple of reasons. Firstly, with highly effective vaccines being rolled out things should start getting back to normal, helping the economy. Now even an indication that the U.S. Fed could revisit its stance on ultra-low interest rates could hit valuations for high-growth stocks like Tesla. There are industry-specific risks as well. Mainstream players such as GM and Volkswagen have been doubling down on EV investments. If these players deliver compelling EVs that are well-received with customers, it could change the narrative around the auto majors and potentially hurt the valuation of pure-play EV companies such as Tesla.

Check out our theme on Electric Vehicle Component Supplier Stocks for more details. [11/18/2020] Tesla Will Join S&P 500, What Does This Mean For The Stock? On Monday, S&P Dow Jones indicated that electric vehicle bellwether Tesla would be included in the S&P 500 index, causing the stock to rally by over 8% in Tuesday’s trading. The inclusion is likely to be effective from December 21, although it could occur in two tranches given that Tesla will be the largest company ever added to the index, and among the top 10 companies by market cap on the S&P 500. So what does this mean for Tesla stock and investors? Firstly, the inclusion could drive strong near-term demand for Tesla stock from not just index funds that track the S&P 500 but possibly from managed funds that are benchmarked to the S&P 500. For perspective, S&P Dow Jones estimates, based on recent market cap data, that funds will need to sell other positions to the tune of around $51 billion to buy Tesla stock. [3] Based on Tesla’s current market cap, this likely translates into roughly 11.5% of Tesla’s total shares outstanding and over 13% of Tesla’s free float (publicly held shares that can be traded without restrictions). Secondly, having a large chunk of Tesla stock held by passive index investors could eventually reduce volatility for Tesla, which has been prone to big swings in the past. That said, the index inclusion doesn’t change the fundamental picture for Tesla. The stock appears pricey in our view, trading at about 110x consensus 2021 earnings, compared to about 26x for the broader S&P 500. At these valuations, Tesla will need to execute very well - banking on new launches such as the Model Y, its international expansion, and higher software sales - to justify its stock price. [Updated 7/15/2020] Will Tesla Be On S&P 500? Tesla’s Software Has One Clue   As a leader in autonomous driving, we estimate that Tesla recorded $1.4 billion in Software Revenue in 2019 via sales of its Full Self Driving software upgrades. These upgrades, which cost about $8,000 per vehicle currently, are also highly lucrative. So How Do Tesla’s Software Upgrades Impact Its Margins? We estimate that they contributed about 400 basis points (4%) to Tesla’s Automotive Gross Margins (revenues less direct costs, divided by revenues) of 21% in 2019. Excluding software sales, Tesla is unlikely to have been profitable over the last few quarters. No discussion about S&P inclusion. How Do Software Sales Impact Tesla’s Margins?

VMW CEO Pat Gelsinger taking over.  The announcement brings to an end Swan's two-year tenure at Intel as CEO. Swan took over the role on an interim basis in June 2018, replacing then-CEO Brain Krzanich, and was later confirmed as the full-time CEO in January 2019.

281,"Another Wall Street analyst has initiated coverage of Tesla Inc TSLA on Wednesday. Like many other analysts and investors, he doesn’t quite know what to make of Tesla at its current valuation. The Tesla Analyst: Edward Jones analyst Jeff Windau initiated coverage of Tesla with a Hold rating. The Tesla Thesis: Windau said Tesla is the clear leader in the global electric vehicle market up to this point. The company will soon face a tidal wave of new competition, however, and its $800 billion market cap is already pricing in a tremendous amount of long-term growth and huge successes in ventures outside of auto sales. “We believe that the market is pricing in 30% to 40% growth in earnings annually on average over the next decade, which will require successful development and launch of products like autonomous driving, semi-trucks and low-cost sedan,” Windau wrote in a note. Windau said Tesla will only maintain its current valuation if the global EV market continues to grow rapidly, Tesla maintains significant market share as more and more competitors come online and Tesla’s new business ventures, including solar energy, insurance and AV technology, are major successes. Related Link: Michael Burry To Tesla Investors: 'Enjoy It While It Lasts'  Windau said one major challenge Tesla will face in the next decade will be funding its growth efforts, which is even more difficult given the company’s non-investment-grade credit rating. If funding becomes an issue down the road, he said Tesla’s growth trajectory could become threatened. In the near term, Windau said Tesla shares will likely continue to be extremely volatile. Benzinga’s Take: Tesla’s market cap has grown to be nearly the size of the entire legacy auto market despite the fact that Tesla represents only a small fraction of global auto sales. However, shorting stocks that are potentially caught in a market bubble can be extremely dangerous given irrational exuberance can last for years and the ultimate top is only reached once investor enthusiasm has died down. © 2024 Benzinga.com.

This contradicts the earlier view of active app user strength, according to the sell-side firm.  The Latin America E-Commerce Analyst: Robert Ford Aguilar said in an industry report that the decline in intent “may be attributable to seasonality and the reopening of retail, but also continued high unemployment, reductions in emergency aid and declining confidence.” The Latin America E-Commerce Thesis: Shopee’s monthly active app user base in the country has exceeded that of Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, Aguilar said in the note. The company may be cannibalizing Wish and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. BABA, the analyst said.  “Shopee’s growth underscores exceptionally strong value perceptions in cross-border offerings, and the potential to further leverage that beachhead into a broader marketplace platform,” the analyst said.

284,"Tesla Inc. TSLA battery supplier Panasonic Corporation PCRFY is working to fulfill the electric vehicle giant's ambition of increasing the affordability of its vehicles. One of the ways? A cobalt-free battery. What Happened: ""Two or three years from now, we will be able to introduce a cobalt-free high energy-density cell,"" Shawn Watanabe, Panasonic head of energy technology and manufacturing, said at the 2021 Consumer Electronics Show, according to a Nikkei report. Panasonic is Tesla’s longtime battery supplier and now produces lithium-ion batteries. Related Link:  Nio Reportedly Planning Entry-Level Models With Cheaper Batteries From CATL  Why It's Important:  Lithium-ion batteries usually have cathodes that contain cobalt. Despite its ability to boost energy density and prolong battery life, cobalt is relatively expensive. This boosts the battery cost, which represents roughly 30% of the EV cost currently. Additionally, cobalt is  mined  primarily in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which uses child labor for the process. Cost consciousness and ethical issues with respect to the supply chain have led to calls for replacing cobalt. The Japanese company's decision to move away from cobalt augurs well for Tesla, as the EV maker is working toward increasing the penetration of clean energy vehicles.

285,"Lion Electric CEO Marc Bedard and Northern Genesis Acquisition Corp's NGA Ian Robertson joined Benzinga’s SPACs Attack show to discuss their merger and growth ahead. The SPAC Deal: Lion Electric is going public via a SPAC due to the speed to market. The merger will save around a year in time and brought $500 million on the balance sheet to keep the competitive edge, Bedard said. Lion Electric going public via SPAC helps the company keep its first-mover advantage and stay ahead of competitors, Robertson said. “The thing that struck us was how conservative they were,” Robertson said of Lion’s financials. With customers like Amazon.com Inc AMZN and others, the “line of sight to 6,000 vehicles is not just aspirational.”  Amazon Partnership: A partnership between Lion Electric and Amazon has been a big headline and helped shares of Northern Genesis trade higher. The deal is for a maximum of 500 units per year allowing Lion to allocate manufacturing capacity to other customers. “There’s no minimum,"" Bedard said. ""It's up to 2,500 units for the next five years."" For fiscal 2026 to fiscal 2030, Amazon has the option for 10% of Lion’s manufacturing capacity. The first two units under a prior ten unit deal with Amazon were delivered over the last few weeks. Related Link: Lion Electric, Nuvve Complete Vehicle-To-Grid Deployment  New Factory: A new production facility is expected to boost the capacities for Lion Electric. Right now, Lion has a capacity for 2,500 units at its Canadian facility. The new U.S. factory is aiming to build over 20,000 units per year. “It’s going to be in Q1 for sure,” Bedard said when asked about the timing of the announcement. Michigan, Illinois and Texas are the finalists, according to the CEO.  Partnerships: Blink Charging Co BLNK, Chargepoint and ABB ABB are all partners with Lion on charging infrastructure. “We need to provide them with the best equipment,” Bedard said on the partnerships helping with customer orders for trucks and buses. “There is so much more to the Lion opportunity than just the great profitable sale of trucks,” Robertson added. Lion also has partnerships for batteries saying a multi-sourcing strategy helps de-risk the company from potential supply issues. Partners for batteries include BMW and Romeo Power RMO. Growth Ahead: Lion Electric has over 10 years of experience in the field and sold its first buses in 2016. Bedard believes the company is ahead of competitors in terms of financing, technology and production. Lion Electric has more products coming in the future with an electric refuse truck, an electric bucket truck and an electric ambulance. Waste Connections WCN is a customer of Lion’s upcoming refuse truck. Bedard said the company is in talks with several refuse customers, but could not disclose names. The new administration under Joe Biden could offer growth for a company like Lion Electric with plans for expansion of electric vehicles and electric buses. “It means a lot to us,” Bedard said on the changing of administration. The push for clean energy and electric buses is one reason why Lion is adding production capacity. “Aren't we at such an incredibly exciting time,” Robertson said.

293,"Tesla Inc TSLA has been asked by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to recall 158,000 Model S and Model X vehicles due to concerns about failing touchscreens. What Happened: The federal agency said in a letter to the Palo Alto, California-based automaker on Wednesday that its Office of Defect Investigation is looking into the media control units whose failures result in loss of rearview camera and other safety-related vehicle functions in the two vehicles. The touchscreen failures relate to model years 2012 through 2018 in the case of Model S and 2016 through 2018 for Model X vehicles, as per the NHTSA. “During an MCU failure, the screen becomes black, and a rearview/backup camera image is no longer available to the driver. If this image is not available, the risk of crash increases potentially causing injury or death,” wrote the NHTSA. Why It Matters: The letter does not make it binding upon Tesla to carry out a recall but if the company decides not to conduct the recall it must provide the ODI with a full explanation of its decision. See Also: Tesla Vehicles Don't Suffer From Unintended Acceleration, NHTSA Says The agency acknowledged that the Elon Musk-led automaker had implemented several over-the-air updates to “attempt to mitigate” some of the issues it described but termed the updates as “procedurally and substantively insufficient.” This is one of the biggest safety recalls affecting Tesla vehicles, the Wall Street Journal reported.  Sam Abuelsamid, a Guidehouse Insights analyst told the Journal that the recall was significant and could cost the automaker between $300 million to $500 million.

Parler was banned from accessing the products and services of Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, Apple Inc. AAPL, and Alphabet Inc. GOOGL GOOG, which effectively forced it to shut down its operations. “I do not believe this was coordinated. More likely: companies came to their own conclusions or were emboldened by the actions of others,” Dorsey said. Trump, meanwhile, has been banned permanently by Snap Inc. SNAP and his accounts have been temporarily restricted by Facebook Inc. FB, Instagram, and YouTube. This moment in time might call for this dynamic, but over the long term it will be destructive to the noble purpose and ideals of the open internet. A company making a business decision to moderate itself is different from a government removing access, yet can feel much the same. Bitcoin As The Answer: As Dorsey noted the need to ensure we don’t “erode a free and open global internet,” he said he was particularly passionate about Bitcoin (BTC) because of the “model it demonstrates.” “A foundational internet technology that is not controlled or influenced by any single individual or entity. This is what the internet wants to be, and over time, more of it will be,” the Twitter CEO said. Dorsey noted his company’s efforts to develop a decentralized standard for social media to overcome the problem of enforcement of policies. “This will take time to build. We are in the process of interviewing and hiring folks, looking at both starting a standard from scratch or contributing to something that already exists,” the Twitter CEO said.  “No matter the ultimate direction, we will do this work completely through public transparency.” It's important that we acknowledge this is a time of great uncertainty and struggle for so many around the world. Our goal in this moment is to disarm as much as we can, and ensure we are all building towards a greater common understanding, and a more peaceful existence on earth.

More likely: companies came to their own conclusions or were emboldened by the actions of others,” Dorsey said. Trump, meanwhile, has been banned permanently by Snap Inc. SNAP and his accounts have been temporarily restricted by Facebook Inc. FB, Instagram, and YouTube. This moment in time might call for this dynamic, but over the long term it will be destructive to the noble purpose and ideals of the open internet. A company making a business decision to moderate itself is different from a government removing access, yet can feel much the same. Bitcoin As The Answer: As Dorsey noted the need to ensure we don’t “erode a free and open global internet,” he said he was particularly passionate about Bitcoin (BTC) because of the “model it demonstrates.” “A foundational internet technology that is not controlled or influenced by any single individual or entity. This is what the internet wants to be, and over time, more of it will be,” the Twitter CEO said. Dorsey noted his company’s efforts to develop a decentralized standard for social media to overcome the problem of enforcement of policies. “This will take time to build. We are in the process of interviewing and hiring folks, looking at both starting a standard from scratch or contributing to something that already exists,” the Twitter CEO said.  “No matter the ultimate direction, we will do this work completely through public transparency.” It's important that we acknowledge this is a time of great uncertainty and struggle for so many around the world. Our goal in this moment is to disarm as much as we can, and ensure we are all building towards a greater common understanding, and a more peaceful existence on earth. Price Action: Twitter shares closed 0.38% higher at $47.22 on Thursday and added another 0.3% gains in the after-hours.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy Connecticut is actively investigating how Amazon.com Inc. sells and distributes digital books, according to the state’s attorney general, the latest of several state and federal probes into the tech giant’s business practices. The investigation is examining whether Amazon engaged in anticompetitive behavior in the e-book business through its agreements with certain publishers, Connecticut Attorney General William Tong said in a statement. GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE Connecticut asked Amazon to provide documents related to its dealings with five of the largest U.S. book publishers, according to a subpoena issued in 2019. The Tech Transparency Project, a nonprofit that investigates technology platforms, obtained the subpoena through an open records request and shared it with The Wall Street Journal. Amazon declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Mr. Tong said the company has cooperated with the subpoena. Connecticut has previously taken interest in the e-book business. In 2012, the U.S. Justice Department alleged in a civil antitrust lawsuit that five major publishers and Apple Inc. had worked together to raise e-book prices. Connecticut, along with Texas, led a similar legal effort by a group of states. “Our office continues to aggressively monitor this market to protect fair competition for consumers, authors, and other e-book retailers,” Mr. Tong said in a statement. AMAZON HITS BACK AT PARLER LAWSUIT, CLAIMS 'UNWILLINGNESS AND INABILITY' TO REMOVE VIOLENT CONTENT The publishers cited in Connecticut’s Amazon subpoena include HarperCollins Publishers, which like The Wall Street Journal is owned by News Corp ; Lagardere SCA’s Hachette Book Group; Penguin Random House, a unit of closely held German media company Bertelsmann SE; Simon & Schuster, the book publishing arm of ViacomCBS Inc. ; and Macmillan. Penguin Random House has agreed to acquire Simon & Schuster, pending regulatory approval. All the publishers cited in the subpoena declined to comment. The Connecticut investigation is one of several ongoing probes into the Seattle-based company’s market power. In October, the House Antitrust Subcommittee completed a 16-month investigation into Amazon and other technology companies, concluding that Amazon has amassed “monopoly power” over sellers on its site. The U.S. Justice Department in 2019 launched a broad investigation of the market power of large technology companies including Amazon, and the Federal Trade Commission has oversight of Amazon as part of a broader look into the business practices of big tech companies. In addition to Connecticut, investigators from California are looking into Amazon’s business practices, the Journal has reported. WORKERS DEMAND AMAZON WEB DROP PARLER OVER POSTS ‘INCITING VIOLENCE’ AFTER CAPITOL RIOT Amazon is the dominant U.S. e-book retailer, accounting for 76% of digital books sold in the U.S. in September, according to Codex Group LLC, a book audience research firm. Rival sellers of digital books include Apple, Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Barnes & Noble. The e-book market has been controversial for years. Amazon kick-started the business when it introduced its Kindle e-reader in November 2007, a launch that offered digital bestsellers for $9.99. The discounted offering helped Amazon build market share, but publishers believed it hurt the industry. A few years later, Apple entered the business as it launched the iPad, with deals that allowed publishers to set the retail prices of their books. That upended the old model, where publishers let retailers set prices for consumers, and effectively blocked discounting without publishers’ approval. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS The Justice Department subsequently filed its civil antitrust suit against Apple and five major publishers. The publishers settled. Apple went to trial but lost. Write to Jeffrey A.

297,"Alibaba Group Holding Ltd BABA launched an electric sedan with state-owned SAIC Motor, China’s largest car company, Nikkei Asia reported Thursday (Hong Kong Time). What Happened: The vehicle, capable of wireless charging, was launched under a new brand — IM. The acronym stands for “intelligence in motion,” according to Nikkei Asia. The car was jointly developed by Alibaba, SAIC, and Shanghai Zhangjiang Hi-Tech Park Development, the investment arm of Shanghai’s local government. The sedan is powered by a new solid-state battery from Contemporary Amperex Technology, which also supplies Tesla Inc TSLA. It also uses chips made by Nvidia Corporation NVDA, as per Nikkei Asia. IM will reportedly begin taking orders for the vehicle in April at the annual Shanghai auto show. A second SUV vehicle may be delivered to customers in 2022. Alibaba shares were up 4.29% in Hong Kong at press-time.  Why It Matters: Sales of new-energy vehicles in China have grown 11% to 1.36 million units in 2020, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, noted Nikkei Asia.  UBS auto analyst Paul Gong projected double-digit growth in overall sales with numbers exceeding the 2019 level to 25.77 million vehicles, as per Nikkei Asia. The Jack Ma-founded company is not the only firm announcing an EV foray. Taiwan’s Hon Hai Precision Industry Co, Ltd HNHPF better known as Foxconn is teaming up with Chinese EV startup Byton to produce its first vehicle — the M-Byte — by the first quarter of 2022. Meanwhile, Foxconn has also signed a cooperative agreement with Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd GELYF to set up a joint venture to provide OEM production and consulting services to global automakers.

300,"The change of leadership at Intel Corporation INTC presents an opportunity to purchase shares of rival chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices, Inc AMD, according to CNBC ""Mad Money"" host Jim Cramer. What Happened: Intel shares rallied nearly 7% Wednesday after the company said it would replace CEO Robert Swan with VMware, Inc’s VMW current chief executive Pat Gelsinger in February. On the same day, AMD shares fell almost 4%. Cramer theorized on “Mad Money” that the change at Intel’s helm presents an opportunity to buy the rival’s stocks. “As much as Intel needs a change, what matters here is that you’re now getting a chance to buy Intel’s more agile rival, AMD, down more than three bucks, for something that might not even happen: a turn at Intel within the next three years,” said the analyst. “I’d much rather buy the stock of a company that’s beating Intel to a pulp, AMD,” Cramer advocated. Why It Matters: Intel is opting to change the hands at the steering when it has lost ground to rivals like AMD, and NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, and lost customers like Apple Inc AAPL. See Also: How To Buy Intel Stock and How To Buy Apple Stock Cramer said that while Gelsinger — also an Intel veteran — did a good job at VMware, Intel needs someone “new, young, hungry who can shake up the culture, if not blow it up entirely.” The former hedge fund manager praised the leadership of AMD CEO Lisa Su and acknowledged that the company under her had gone from “always second fiddle to Intel” to “being the one that makes better chips.” Price Action: Intel shares closed 6.97% higher at $56.95 on Wednesday. On the same day, AMD shares closed 3.75% lower and gained 0.46% in the after-hours session.

302,"Tesla Inc TSLA is seeking the U.S. Federal Communications Commission approval for a new radar sensor. What Happened: Tesla’s FCC application contains a test report dated Jan. 5, 2021, for the Vehicle Millimeter-wave Radar Sensor in 60 GHz band (60-64 GHz), first reported by Electrek on Wednesday. The equipment under test measures 67 mm (L) X 48 mm (W) X 11 mm (H) and weighs approximately 0.1 kg, as per the report. The Elon Musk-led company has applied for confidentiality for the sensor, as per Electrek, which noted more information and pictures on the device wouldn't be available until July 2021 — when the confidentiality expires. See Also: How To Buy Tesla Stock. Why It Matters: Tesla is betting on cameras and radar in furthering its self-driving push, with Musk taking a public stance against the use of lidar sensors, noted Electrek.  Musk said this week that even if the cost of lidar sensors became zero, Tesla would not utilize them. “I mean totally free, well, I think even if it was free, we wouldn’t put it on,” Musk told an analyst, as per Electrek. The new sensor reportedly appears to be a move that would improve the company’s efforts to enable full-self driving. Recently, Tesla rival Nio Inc NIO launched a new electric sedan in China that features high-resolution Lidar.  See Also: How To Buy Nio Stock.

303,"The anti-competition investigations against Jeff Bezos’ Amazon Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) have now spilled over into its e-books business in Connecticut, according to the Wall Street Journal. Reportedly, a similar investigation is also underway in California. What Happened: The Journal cited Connecticut’s Attorney General William Tong, saying Amazon’s agreement with publishers is under probe for anticompetitive behavior. “Our office continues to aggressively monitor this market to protect fair competition for consumers, authors, and other e-book retailers,” Tong said. Reportedly, the Connecticut authorities have sought access to documents pertaining to five of the significant publishers in the U.S, based on a subpoena filed in 2019. The Tech Transparency Project — a nonprofit, nonpartisan watchdog organization, was the first to secure this subpoena. Why Does It Matter: With a 76% share of e-book sales in September — based on the research by Codex Group LLC, and a dedicated Kindle business for e-book readers, Amazon is a key player in this segment. The five publishers named in the subpoena include News Corp’s (NASDAQ: NWSA) HarperCollins Publishers, Hachette Book Group — a wholly-owned subsidiary of the French media company Lagardere SCA (OTC: LGDDF), Bertelsmann SE’s Penguin Random House, ViacomCBS Inc’s (NASDAQ: VIAC) (NASDAQ: VIACA) publishing division Simon & Schuster and Macmillan Publishers, as per the Journal.

306,"Grain commodity futures now find themselves among the ranks of 2021’s other parabolic upward movers like Bitcoin and Tesla Inc TSLA. Corn futures are up about 26% since the most recent intraday lows on Dec. 2, while Soybean futures have risen about 23% during the same time. Soybeans have seen a strong move upward on high volume since the new year. However, the /ZS contract is closing in on the 1450 level, which represents two standard deviations from the yearly Linear Regression Line and could likely be a point technical traders are watching for a stall in the trend. To the downside, watch for buyers to step in near the Parabolic SAR at 1374 and the 21-day Exponential Moving Average at 1314. Corn is also showing lofty prices after eclipsing the 500 level with a big breakout, but yesterday saw aggressive selling after reaching 540 and it finished on a doji. For the /ZC contract, look for support at the confluence of previous resistance and the Parabolic SAR around 500, and also near the 21-day EMA at 480.

On Jan. 14, 2000, the Dow Jones Industrial Average reached its dot-com bubble peak. What Else Was Going On In The World? In 2000, Vermont passed HB847, a bill legalizing Civil Unions for same-sex couples. The final “Peanuts” comic was published following creator Charles Schultz’s death. The average monthly rent in the U.S. was $675. Dow Tops Out: The tech-centric Nasdaq was the epicenter of the dot-com bubble, but a rising tide lifts all boats. In the two years leading up to Jan. 14, 2000, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 50.5%. The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 wouldn’t hit their dot-com era peaks until March of 2000, but the Dow beat them to the punch, topping out at 11,750 on Jan. 14. Over the next two years, the Dow dropped 15.6%, but it held up relatively well compared to the 22.3% drop in the S&P 500 and the 51% drop in the Nasdaq. At the time, the Dow’s largest components included General Electric Company GE, Exxon Mobil Corporation XOM and Microsoft Corporation MSFT. Following its January 2000 peak, the Dow wouldn’t make new all-time highs again until 2006. However, it fared much better than the Nasdaq, which wouldn’t surpass its dot-com bubble peak until 2015. Investors who bought the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust DIA on the day the Dow peaked back in 2000 and held until today would be sitting on a more than 300% total return. © 2024 Benzinga.com.

312,"Intel Corporation INTC  announced a new CEO Wednesday, sending the chipmaker's shares higher by about 7%. The Intel Analysts: Needham analyst Quinn Bolton upgraded Intel from Hold to Buy and assigned a $70 price target. BMO Capital Markets analyst Ambrish Srivastava upgraded Intel shares from Market Perform to Outperform and lifted the price target from $50 to $70. Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore upgraded Intel from Equal-weight to Overweight and increased the price target from $60 to $70. Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann maintained a Sell rating and $40 price target. How Gelsinger Could Reestablish Processor Leadership:  With incoming CEO Pat Gelsinger's technical acumen, he should be able to identify any weaknesses in Intel's processor roadmap and lead it to reestablish processor performance leadership, Needham analyst Bolton said in a note.  Gelsinger should be able to motivate the engineering teams at Intel, and if the company is able to stem its market share losses, its earnings outlook will improve and its valuation multiple will expand, the analyst said. The higher-than-expected capital expenditure Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. TSM announced for 2021 is a strong signal that Intel will announce meaningful programs to outsource some advanced manufacturing, thereby reducing its capital intensity, improving free cash flow and improving shareholder returns, he said.  Gelsinger Is The Right Choice, BMO Says:  Intel has an opportunity with a new CEO at the helm, BMO analyst Srivastava said. Although big changes aren't likely in the near-term, the company could benefit from the richness of experience that Gelsinger brings from his prior tenure at Intel as well as his experience running VMware, Inc. VMW, the analyst said.  Gelsinger is the right person to address the daunting, but not insurmountable, challenges  that Intel faces, he said.  ""And given the series of disappointments from Intel, even a few incremental right steps ought to serve as a catalyst for shares.""  Related Link:  5 Reasons To Stay Positive On Intel  Morgan Stanley On Intel's CEO Transition:  Intel's relative valuation versus the semiconductor group has compressed meaningfully, as the company faces significant technology challenges due to self-inflicted problems and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.'s AMD product success, Morgan Stanley analyst Moore said. Therefore, Intel's market share will most likely decline in the period from 2021 to 2022, the analyst said.  Intel has no quick turnaround or financial fix, he said.  Intel's positives include good decision making around critical make vs. buy outsourcing decisions, and executing on roadmap timing, Moore said. AMD will continue to be a substantial factor and will gain share, but Intel can still protect the value of its incumbency just by executing on what's in front of it, the analyst said.   On the flipside, if there is risk to product launch timelines, a clearer disclosure of the risks is likely, as a more customer- and technology-centric management team will want to be more transparent and open about the roadmap, he said.  Moore sees the potential for downside in the near-term, as he said Intel could stop optimizing around near-term earnings and focus on what needs to be done to protect its incumbency.  Why Gelsinger's Appointment Could Be A Little Late:  Gelsinger is the best option for Intel at this time, but he should have taken over the reins from Brian Krzanich in early 2019, Rosenblatt analyst Mosesmann said. ""Indeed, to fix Intel will require what former Jim Keller Intel architect wanted: a total CPU reset. Build a CPU from scratch for the new AI world,"" the analyst said. ""That is a many, many year endeavor."" In the meantime, the analyst expects AMD, Broadcom Inc AVGO, Marvell Technology Group Ltd. MRVL, NVIDIA Corporation NVDA and Xilinx, Inc. XLNX to accelerate share gains in the key compute, networking, and storage segment.

The Nvidia Thesis:  Mosesmann is positive on the opportunities that lie ahead for Nvidia, including a recurring revenue stream from Auto, data center inferencing and gaming, following the company's ""Virtual Fireside Chat"" with Nvidia's CFO Colette Kress. Automotive is likely to be the strongest catalyst, and the company could announce more partnerships with Automotive OEMs over the course of the year, the analyst said.

Just take this short survey to see which one is best for you. By jhill Updated Jun 16, 2021 at 1:24PM
 Big Tech stocks have had a great run over the last few years. They’ve only gotten bigger, and the top five of them now make up close to 25% of the total S&P 500. That’s a huge slice of the pie. Although, with that dominance comes a new round of challenges. More politicians and regulators are clamping down. Old antitrust laws don’t apply as well because many of the tech companies offer free services. But politicians are getting more creative and new ideas are on the horizon to break up Big Tech. Whether that comes to fruition or not, these companies will continue to push sales higher. And if you buy into a company that’s broken up, you still might automatically own all the pieces. Some of the stocks below could easily continue to be market leaders. They’ve created services that billions of people willingly use around the world.  When talking big numbers, it’s easy to gloss over them. So I want to first give some examples that show how big some of these companies have become… Coming in first place is Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) with more than a $2 trillion market cap. At that level, it’s worth more than Canada’s entire GDP. And if we could spread ownership of Apple evenly among every American, we could each collect more than $6,500. Facebook is another juggernaut with hard-to-fathom numbers. In its recent quarterly filing, it reported 1.82 billion daily average users. And if those are unique users, that’s close to 25% of the world’s population… on a daily basis! Facebook also reported 2.74 billion monthly active users. So that climbs to 35% of the world’s total population. And unless you’ve been living under a rock, you’ve benefited from Facebook’s free services and innovation. Of course, big changes and innovation come with downsides, but ultimately no one has to use these companies’ products and services. There are hundreds and likely thousands of alternatives. Yet these Big Tech stocks have been great investments so far… *Numbers from January 13, 2021 For one last example to put their size in perspective… Amazon is now much larger than the next five largest retailers combined. That’s Amazon’s $1.6 trillion valuation compared with a total of $1.1 trillion for Walmart (NYSE: WMT), Home Depot (NYSE: HD), Costco (Nasdaq: COST), Lowe’s (NYSE: LOW) and Target (NYSE: TGT). Also, it’s good to note that many existing companies are becoming technology companies. To survive and stay competitive, they have to use more technology. Walmart, for example, is a staple consumer goods company (here’s a list of 20 consumer staple stocks). Although, it’s been investing heavily in online platforms and other technologies to keep up. Thanks to its supply chain innovation, Walmart now offers next-day delivery to 75% of the U.S. population. We’ll see this trend continue with all companies. And going forward, that gives us even better investing opportunities… Many of these Big Tech stocks will continue to outperform. They’ve not only survived but thrived during the pandemic. On top of that, these companies have managed well through different political agendas in the past. So, barring an economic collapse, it could pay well to add a few of these companies to your portfolio. Or even better yet, there are smaller opportunities with even higher growth potential. Imagine if you invested in Apple 20 years ago! To uncover some of the top investing opportunities around, you can find our recent technology investing research here.

315,"Tesla Inc TSLA has some of the safest cars on the road, according to NHTSA testing. The Model Y recently scored a five-star safety rating in all categories tested.  Every quarter, Tesla releases a safety report showing how many accidents per mile occur in the company's vehicles. The stats are broken down into three categories: accidents using Autopilot, accidents without Autopilot but with active safety features and accidents where all safety features, including Autopilot, are turned off.  In the fourth quarter, Tesla vehicles using Autopilot had an accident every 3.45 million miles, the company said. Vehicles without Autopilot but with Tesla's active safety features turned on were in an accident every 2.05 milliion miles, and vehicles with no active safety features were in an accident every 1.27 million miles driven.  Tesla compares this data to NHTSA data showing there is a car accident every 484,000 miles on average. While the miles from the NHTSA aren't the same as miles in a Tesla, or even a Tesla using Autopilot, the data shows a Tesla driver is far less likely to experience an accident than an average driver. Many say Tesla's naming of the company's driver assist tech is misleading, even going as far as being sued by the German government, but the data here shows users with the Autopilot ability, despite its name, are in far fewer accidents.  Photo courtesy of Tesla.  © 2024 Benzinga.com.

325,"Bitcoin (BTC) briefly crossed the $40,000 mark on Thursday after having retreated to near $30,000-levels this week. The apex cryptocurrency had hit an all-time high of $41,962.36 last weekend. At press time, Bitcoin traded 3.88% higher at $38,918.37. Ethereum (ETH), the cryptocurrency with the second-largest market cap, was up 8.75% at $1,219.67 at press time. XRP (XRP), which was outperforming Bitcoin earlier this week on news of a former Amazon.com Inc. AMZN executive joining Ripple Inc — the payments company behind the cryptocurrency — has since retreated on news of Grayscale moving to dissolve its XRP Trust. XRP traded 3.48% lower at $0.2967. Polkadot (DOT), an enabler of communication between blockchains, has entered the top five cryptocurrencies by market up, with a $13.28 billion valuation. The cryptocurrency traded at $14.38, up 34.3% over 24-hours and 52.36% over seven days.

326,"BlackBerry Ltd BB surged nearly 37% in the regular and after-hours sessions on Thursday. What Happened: The spike in the stock came after the company sold 90 patents linked to smartphone technology to China’s Huawei, according to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office records cited by Canada’s The Globe and Mail newspaper. The Canadian firm’s patents reportedly include innovations related to the presentation of text and images depending on the orientation of the device. Other patents relate to geotagging of images and security features. Why It Matters: There are said to be 38,000 patents in BlackBerry’s patent library, reported Techradar.com. Blackberry, once a leading name in the smartphone market, has withered away from the industry as it failed to compete against offerings of Apple Inc AAPL and Alphabet Inc GOOGL GOOG.
The sale of the patents to Huawei has evoked national security concerns among some Canadian allies, as per Techradar.com.

327,"Tesla Inc TSLA is still the leader among the electric vehicle pack even though the competition in the space is intensifying, according to Wedbush Securities.  The Tesla Analyst: Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives maintained his Neutral rating on the automaker and increased the 12-month price target to $950 from $715. The analyst established a bull case target of $1,250 upping it from the previous $1,000 target. The Tesla Thesis: The Elon Musk-led automaker now exceeds the one million delivery threshold in 2022 and could approach five million deliveries annually by the end of the decade, if global EV demand maintains the current pace, Ives wrote in a note Thursday. “We believe overall that EVs, which make up 3% of global auto sales today, could reach 5% by the end of 2021 and 10% by 2025,” he said. Ives termed Tesla’s competitors like Nio Inc NIO, Xpeng Inc XPEV, and Li Auto Inc LI  in the key Chinese market as “impressive.” “There are 150+ auto makers aggressively going after the EV opportunity globally, right now in the EV market we believe it's Tesla's world and everyone else is paying rent.”  Wedbush expects 40% of Tesla’s overall delivery sales would come from China, followed by Europe and the U.S. “We believe that the China growth story is worth at least $100 per share in a bull case to Tesla as this EV penetration is set to ramp significantly over the next 12 to 18 months, along with major battery innovations coming out of Giga 3.”  Other positives for the Palo Alto, California-based automaker include a Biden White House and a Blue Senate.

331,"The outgoing Donald Trump administration issued new rules Thursday related to self-driving vehicles in the United States, which would allow such vehicles to be exempted from certain crash standards applicable to traditional vehicles. What Happened: The new rules, which will cut costs, only apply to vehicles that carry goods, according to The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The rules reportedly also pave the way for manufacturers of passenger-carrying autonomous vehicles to build autos without certain controls such as steering wheels.
See Also: GM, Cruise To Seek NHTSA Approval For Self-Driving Cars With No Steering Wheels, Pedals “We do not want regulations enacted long before the development of automated technologies to present an unintended and unnecessary barrier to innovation and improved vehicle safety,” said James Owens, deputy NHTSA administrator, in a statement. A grouping called the Self-Driving Coalition — which includes the likes of Alphabet Inc’s GOOGL GOOG self-driving unit Waymo, Ford Motor Company F, Uber Inc UBER —  hailed the rule change saying it addresses barriers to innovation “while preserving the important safety protections afforded to vehicle occupants by NHTSA’s current standards,” Reuters reported. Why It Matters: NHTSA estimates peg the savings to automated vehicle manufacturers in the region of $5.8 billion in the year 2050 or at $995 per vehicle, based on an estimated production number of 5.8 million units. The move was criticized by Cathy Chase, president of Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety who accused NHTSA of “kowtowing to the auto industry’s priority of removing so-called regulatory barriers in order to facilitate the introduction of autonomous vehicles.” Tesla Inc. TSLA CEO Elon Musk said last month that full self-driving would be ready in 2021, which means both the driver and a steering wheel would be optional.

332,"The outgoing President Donald Trump’s administration continues to add pressure on China even as its term nears an end. In the latest move, U.S. has added China’s leading smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp XIACF and its third-biggest driller CNOOC Ltd CEO to blacklisted firms — baning them from American investment due to ties with the Chinese military, Bloomberg reported on Thursday. What Happened: Xiaomi was added to the Department of Defense (DoD) list of nine companies for alleged military ties. “The Department is determined to highlight and counter the People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) Military-Civil Fusion development strategy, which supports the modernization goals of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) by ensuring its access to advanced technologies and expertise acquired and developed by even those PRC companies, universities, and research programs that appear to be civilian entities,” DoD said in a statement. Companies in the DoD list are prohibited from American exchanges and investment. As per the administration’s amended order, investors have a November 2021 deadline to sell sanctioned securities. Cnooc was added to the Department of Commerce (DoC) list — which denies access to U.S. technologies for the driller without specific permission. Bloomberg noted that the list is under an order issued in December that has blacklisted more than 60 companies. “China’s reckless and belligerent actions in the South China Sea and its aggressive push to acquire sensitive intellectual property and technology for its militarization efforts are a threat to U.S. national security and the security of the international community,"" Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a press release. ""Cnooc acts as a bully for the People’s Liberation Army to intimidate China’s neighbors, and the Chinese military continues to benefit from government civil-military fusion policies for malign purposes.” Why It Matters: Xiaomi’s stock crashed 10% in Hong Kong on the news. The company hit back by saying “it provides products and services for civilian and commercial use."" ""The Company confirms that it is not owned, controlled, or affiliated with the Chinese military, and is not a ‘Communist Chinese Military Company’ defined under the NDAA,” Xiaomi said in a statement, as per CNBC. Xiaomi is the third-largest smartphone maker globally, and this move could have future implications, CNBC notes. The smartphone has not been put on the “Entity List,” which bans sanctioned companies from using American technology. Xiaomi uses chips from QUALCOMM, Inc. QCOM. As per the Bloomberg report, the move against Xiaomi was unexpected, which is viewed as China’s answer to Apple Inc AAPL. Unless the ban is reversed, Xiaomi risks being delisted from U.S. exchanges and deleted from global benchmark indexes. So far, the government has left three major companies — Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE: BABA), Tencent Holdings (OTC: TCEHY), and Baidu Inc (NASDAQ: BIDU) off the ban list considering the potential economic impact. Price Action: XIACF closed 9.35% lower at $3.88 on Thursday, and CEO closed 5.02% higher at $102.71.

333,"Apple Inc AAPL is working towards bringing its Music and Podcast apps to Microsoft Corporation’s MSFT Store later this year, 9to5Mac reported Thursday. What Happened: The Tim Cook-led company is testing both the apps meant for Microsoft platforms in private beta, sources told 9to5Mac. There is reportedly no confirmation on whether these apps would work only with the Xbox or also be compatible with Windows personal computers. Why It Matters: The Cupertino, California-based company offers iTunes, which was continued on the OS X platform in 2019, for Windows, noted 9to5Mac. The non-updated Windows app is reportedly a reason why Apple could bring Music and Podcast apps to the Microsoft PC platform. The iPhone maker made available its Apple TV app on Xbox One, Series X, and Series S consoles in November.

What Happened: The Vaccine Credential Initiative also includes MITRE, Mayo Clinic, Evernorth, The Commons Project Foundation, and CARIN Alliance among others, as per a statement issued Thursday.  “As the world begins to recover from the pandemic, having electronic access to vaccination, testing, and other medical records will be vital to resuming travel and more,” said Mike Sicilia, executive vice president of Oracle’s global business units.  The group anticipates that a trustworthy, traceable, verifiable, and universally recognized digital record of vaccination is urgently needed. Why It Matters: The body wants to empower individuals to obtain an encrypted copy of the inoculation credentials and store it in a digital wallet of choice — like those provided by Apple Inc AAPL or Alphabet Inc GOOGL GOOG unit Google. Alternatively, users could print out a paper copy of the credentials containing a QR code.

337,"Apple Inc AAPL is planning a major design upgrade to its MacBook Pro range of notebooks for the first time since the 2016 lineup, according to TF International Securities analyst Ming-chi Kuo. What Happened:  Kuo said that the Touch Bar will be replaced by physical function keys in the new version of the computer and the MagSafe charger will mark its return, 9to5Mac reported Thursday. Other rollbacks by the Tim Cook-led company include the addition of more built-in IO ports, which would eliminate the need to purchase dongles, as per Kuo. The tech giant is also planning on updating the displays of the notebooks with brighter higher-contrast panels, Bloomberg reported. The new Pro series computers will come equipped with Apple’s ARM chips instead of the ones made by Intel Corporation INTC. The laptop’s chassis would have squared-off sides in both the top and bottom halves, according to the analyst.  The new model is expected in both 14 and 16-inch sizes and will utilize a similar heat pipe system as the current generation 16-inch model, allowing for better performance due to more thermal headroom, Kuo said, as reported by the Verge.  Kuo revealed that the design upgrade is scheduled for the third quarter of 2021. Why It Matters: In November, the Cupertino, California-based tech giant launched the 13-inch MacBook Pro with the M1 chip at its “One More Thing” live event. See Also: Apple Highlights New M1 Chip, Shift Away From Intel At 'One More Thing' Event The new 13-inch MacBook Pro retains the Touch Bar and comes with an identical hardware design to the previous range.

344,"The Tesla Inc TSLA Model S and X vehicles have remained largely unchanged since initial release. The vehicles have received updates to batteries, suspension and other small areas, but the interior and exterior look and features are very similar to the Model S first released in 2012. Now Electrek is reporting that Tesla is directing its employees to get rid of all Model S and X inventory by the end of the month. While it's normal for a business to want to sell its product, having a push like this before the end of the quarter is quite unusual. In December, Tesla shut down production of the Model S and X to make improvements to the production lines. The lines were shut down for almost an entire month.  Rumors of a refresh of the Model S and X have been swirling for a while. Tesla hacker Green has shared details found in his Tesla's code hinting at new interior features such as a driver- and passenger-monitoring camera. Green has a very good track record, and historically, the features he finds in the code come to life within months of discovery. Click here to check out Benzinga's EV Hub for the latest electric vehicle news. Benzinga's Take: This refresh has been talked about by fans for years. People have constantly been asking CEO Elon Musk on Twitter about design changes. Pent-up demand for the expensive luxury vehicles could be unleashed if the refresh does occur. It's also expected to bring Tesla's Plaid Model S with 4680 battery cells.  Photo courtesy of Tesla. © 2024 Benzinga.com. Benzinga does not provide investment advice. All rights reserved.

345,"Apple Inc AAPL supplier Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd.-ADR HNHPF, widely known as Foxconn, has announced a high-profile appointment for its newly created open electric vehicle platform. What Happened:  Foxconn has appointed Jack Cheng, co-founder of Chinese EV start-up Nio Inc – ADR NIO, as head of MIH, its open software and hardware platform for developing EVs,  local Chinese media outlets  reported. William Wei, the unit's chief technology officer, will assume responsibility for software, the report said. Related Link:  Apple Supplier Foxconn Confirms It Will Make Electric Vehicles With Chinese Startup Byton  Cheng is an auto industry veteran, with over four decades of experience at companies such as Ford Motor Company F and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV FCAU. Cheng, along with William Li, was responsible for putting in place the core team at Nio in the second half of 2015. After quitting  Nio  in 2019, Cheng worked for XPT, which develops core components for Nio. Foxconn established the MIH platform in October to diversify into EV sector. Earlier this week, Foxconn announced  a 50-50 joint venture with Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd GELYF to provide OEM production and comprehensive, customized consulting services to global automakers. Why It's Important:  The appointment of Cheng suggests Foxconn is contemplating a big push into the EV market.

The Lemonade Bear Case: In a Twitter live video, Left dismissed Lemonade Inc's claims of bringing new technology to the insurance industry, saying the company's technology is no different from insurers like Progressive Corp. PGR or State Farm. ""They've been lying to their customers and their shareholders,"" said the noted short seller. The company has not responded to a request for comment. See also: Lemonade Home Insurance Review Not An ESG Company: He also blasted Lemonade's claims of being a ""social good"" company as an easy marketing ploy.

Lemonade insiders have sold $400 million in the past six months but gave just $1 million to charity last year, he said.

Of course, much of the attention during the week was focused on the political drama in Washington, D.C. The U.S. president became the first ever to be impeached twice, after the prior week's chaos at the U.S. Capitol.

358,"The Samsung Galaxy Fold is one foldable phone already on the market. Apple is working on a foldable iPhone, Bloomberg has reported. What Happened: Apple Inc AAPL has started working on a new iPhone model with a foldable screen. The tech giant has developed prototype screens and is still in the process of internal testing, according to Bloomberg. There has not been an official decision on any launches, the financial news outlet reported. The prototype screen would make the iPhone bigger and “more pocketable.”  A person familiar with the testing told Bloomberg that screens would have “a mostly invisible hinge with the electronics stationed behind the display.”  Why It Matters: Apple has not announced any major changes for 2021 production yet, fresh off changes it made in 2020 for new designs, package conditions and 5G. But the Cupertino, California-based company is trying out one new feature: an in-screen fingerprint reader to unlock the smartphone. Under current conditions, where people have to wear masks due to the COVID-19 pandemic, making facial recognition difficult, this feature would be useful to iPhone users. Price Action: Apple shares fell 0.25% and closed at $126.82 in the post-market trading on Friday, after a $127.14 close in the regular hours trading. Image credit: Unsplash.com © 2024 Benzinga.com.

360,"Tesla Model Y Tesla Inc TSLA is taking legal action againt a Chinese tech media outlet called PingWest that earlier reported of harsh working conditions and quality control problem at Tesla's Shanghai Gigafactory. What Happened: Tesla reportedly has sent an ""indictment"" and other legal notices to PingWest over a report the outlet published on Dec. 25.  The report, published in Chinese and English, claimed that workers toil under ""sweatshop"" conditions at the Shanghai factory, and that the company was cutting corners on quality to speed up production. Unnamed workers describe the plant is being low-tech and high-pressure, with bosses who are overly demanding — in other words, like a stereotypical Chinese factory. ""PingWest has found that the insanely high production volume has not been the direct result of the technological advancement that Tesla is known for, but rather the same old high-intensity manual labor that still plagues many industries inside China,"" PingWest reported. ""Workers who spoke to PingWest said that in reality, Tesla's Shanghai factory was not much different from other automotive plants they've worked at."" Today, the Global Times, a Chinese Communist Party-controlled tabloid, reports that Tesla sent PingWest an ""indictment, a notice of responding to prosecution, as well as other affidavit."" Global Times cites a statement issued today by PingWest, formally known as Beijing PingWest Interact Technology Co. PingWest has until Feb. 8 to respond and says it will ""actively cooperate"" with Tesla's lawsuit, Global Times reported. Words Followed By Action: Tesla earlier had threated this legal action. Tao Lin, Tesla China's vice president for external affairs, called the PingWest report ""outrageous"" as soon as it came out and promised legal action would follow, according to CX Tech, a branch of the business publication Caixin.  CX Tech also reported that the spat has led to rumors swirling online in China: ""Some internet users [suggest] that He Xiaopeng, CEO of Tesla’s domestic rival Xpeng, holds a stake in the media outlet, an allegation denied by PingWest."" Why It Matters: China is a hugely important market for Tesla and partly why the stock price skyrocketed more than 700% in 2020. Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives predicted in November that 40% of Tesla sales could come from China by 2022. And orders for the company's Model Y, produced in Shanghai, reportedly ate up the full first quarter's worth of supply within days, just after opening up a web page for orders at the start of the year.

363,"The U.S. government recently sent out its second round of stimulus payments worth up to $600 per qualified person. The primary purpose of the payments was to help those who are struggling to make ends meet during the pandemic, but stimulus spending can also serve as a much-needed shot in the arm for the economy. Bank of America economist Michelle Meyer recently took a close look at the bank’s credit-card data to determine how Americans who received stimulus payments are spending their money. Related Link: Gary Gensler Could Be The Next SEC Chair: What Investors Need To Know  Stimulus Spending Bump: Most payments were distributed through the first week of January, so Meyer focused on any changes in spending behavior among those that received payments. “Total card spending for stimulus recipients is up nearly 20% year-over-year average since Jan. 1, which is almost 4X the December average growth rate,” Meyer said Thursday. The jump in spending was highest among lower-income households. Those households spent an average of nearly 40% more after receiving their payments than those that did not receive payments. See also: How to Invest Your $1,400 Stimulus Check For investors wondering where all that stimulus money is flowing, Meyer said clothing, online electronics, general merchandise and home improvements saw the biggest jump in spending. Winners And Losers: For the week ending Jan. 9, Bank of America reported online electronics spending was up 75% from a year ago. Other leading categories include furniture (+36%) and general merchandise (+30%). Spending categories that look the biggest year-over-year hits include entertainment (-76%), air travel (-68%) and transit (-31%). A recent Benzinga sentiment survey also found that many Americans are investing their stimulus checks. Electric vehicle stocks like Tesla Inc TSLA and Nio Inc - ADR NIO were among the most popular investments. Coronavirus vaccine stocks like Moderna Inc MRNA and Pfizer Inc PFE were also among the most popular investments. Benzinga’s Take: It’s good to see Americans can afford to spend the stimulus check on something other than bills and aren’t afraid to spend or invest that money. The more stimulus payments are spent rather than simply being saved, the more more positive impact the payments can have on the economy. Photo by Karolina Grabowska from Pexels © 2024 Benzinga.com.

366,"Apple Inc AAPL CEO Tim Cook has commented about the company’s decision to suspend Parler from its App Store. What Happened: ""We're always trying to do the right thing,"" Cook said, talking to Fox News host Chris Wallace.   Answering Wallace’s question about whether or not big tech is restricting speech, Cook said: ""We have an App Store that has about 2 million apps in it. And we have terms of service for these apps. We obviously don’t control what’s on the internet, but we’ve never viewed that our platform should be a simple replication of the internet. We have certain rules and regulations, and we just ask that people abide by those.” When asked whether there could be a balance between free speech and objectionable content, the chief executive said he doesn’t believe there’s a place for violence when it comes to free speech. ""We looked at the incitement to violence that was on there, and we don’t consider that free speech and incitement of violence has an intersection,"" he said. Apple took down Parler on Jan. 9, a day after sending a warning note to the platform’s executives demanding they provide a moderation plan within 24 hours. Cook said the company is not banned but rather suspended, and could be allowed back. ""If they get their moderation together, they would be back on there,” Cook said during the interview. Cook and Wallace also discussed Apple's $100 million Racial Equity Initiative, which last week launched an Apple Developer Academy in Detroit. Why It Matters: Parler, viewed as a far-right social media platform, has come under fire since the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. It has been accused of failing to moderate discussions and plans of the attack.  Google Inc GOOGL GOOG removed Parler from its Android app store market on Jan. 8.

372,"When it comes to producing more vehicles, Tesla Inc's TSLA biggest supply issue is batteries. The company just can't get enough batteries to build all the vehicles it wants. Because of this, Tesla decided to start its own battery factory with its new 4680 battery cells. Tesla will also still receive batteries from current partners such as LG Chem and Panasonic. After posting a video of the battery factory in action, CEO Elon Musk talked about some of the inspiration behind Tesla's battery production decisions. Battery cell production is the fundamental rate-limiter slowing down a sustainable energy future. Very important problem. https://t.co/MYOUSAC2AK Musk tweeted that the best manufacturing technology is in high volume industries like food and beverages, medical devices, and toys. And the battery production line shown in the video does look similar to a bottling plant. Musk went on to say the giant press production method for the Model Y Tesla is attempting to ""make full-size cars in the same way that toy cars are made."" Click here to check out Benzinga's EV Hub for the latest electric vehicle news. Benzinga's Take: It will be interesting to see if Tesla's production strategies pay off going forward. On battery day, Tesla mentioned battery prices could eventually fall as much as 50%, while also being able to supply enough cells to satisfy Tesla Semi, Roadster, Model S, X, and Cybertruck. Tesla's Plaid version Model S is expected by the end of 2021, although Musk hinted it may be coming sooner. Photo courtesy of Tesla © 2024 Benzinga.com. Benzinga does not provide investment advice.

375,"Tesla Inc TSLA began making deliveries of Model Y vehicles in China on Monday. What Happened: The Elon Musk-led company posted photographs of customers taking deliveries of the mid-sized electric sports utility vehicle on its Twitter feed. 欢迎! Model Y deliveries in China have officially begun pic.twitter.com/fG5aax1k2b The initial Shanghai deliveries will be followed by other cities, according to Tesla, reported Xinhua — a Chinese government news agency. Why It Matters: The Model Y went on sale in China at the beginning of 2021 and garnered enough orders to exhaust supplies for the first three months of 2021, according to Electrek.  See Also: Mass Amount Of Tesla Model Y Vehicles Spotted At Gigafactory Shanghai, Appear Ready For Delivery Priced at RMB 339,900 ($52,376) in China, analysts expect the SUV to boost Tesla’s Chinese sales and emerge as a disrupter in the East Asian country’s auto market this year. The price of the vehicle is less than a tenth of similar gas-powered luxury cars made by the likes of Daimler AG DDAIF, Bayerische Motoren Werke AG BMWYY, and Volkswagen AG VWAGY, as per Reuters. The vehicle will also threaten the growing dominance of homespun EV companies such as Nio Inc NIO, Xpeng Inc XPEV, BYD Company Ltd BYDDF, and Li Auto Inc LI.

What Happened: The website’s functionality at the time seems limited to displaying a few messages from the Parler team. “Our return is inevitable due to hard work, and persistence against all odds. Despite the threats and harassment, not one Parler employee has quit. We are becoming closer and stronger as a team,” John Matze says in the latest statement on the Parler website.

378,"Xpeng Inc XPEV has unveiled a new beta autonomous driving solution, which will help its flagship P7 sedan compete with similar offerings from Tesla Inc TSLA, CNBC reported Monday. What Happened: The new feature — called the Navigation Guided Pilot (NGP) — is a part of the company’s XPILOT 3.0 autonomous driving package, the company said in a statement.  Xpeng said that the NGP function is expected to be released to customers in China in the next few weeks. The Guangzhou, China-based automaker said on its launch the feature would be implemented in the Premium version of the P7 with the ""XPILOT 3.0"" system. “[NGPs] full-scenario high-definition positioning capability solves HD-map positioning challenges for China’s highly complex road conditions, including areas with no GPS signals,” said Xpeng. Why It Matters: NGP will allow the P7 to automatically change lanes, change speed or overtake other vehicles and enter or exit highways, according to CNBC. Xpeng's NGP provides features similar to Tesla's ""Navigate on Autopilot,"" the publication noted. Tesla CEO Elon Musk said last month that its own full-self driving software would get “absurdly good” in the future.

379,"Apple Inc. AAPL has been sued in California over allegations it failed to take action against messaging app Telegram in the aftermath of the Capitol Hill riot even as the platform was used to promote violence. What Happened: The Coalition for a Safer Web,  a Washington D.C.-based non-profit organization, filed the lawsuit against Apple in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California on Sunday. The group alleges that “Telegram is being used to intimidate, threaten, and coerce members of the public,” and Apple — despite reportedly having this knowledge — lets Telegram be available through the App Store on its devices. The lawsuit further alleges that not only was Telegram used to promote violence during the storming of Capitol Hill by outgoing President Donald Trump’s supporters earlier this month, also “for years, anti-black and anti-Semitic groups have openly utilized Telegram with little or no content moderation by Telegram’s management.” “Apple has not taken any action against Telegram comparable to the action it has taken against Parler to compel Telegram to improve its content moderation policies.” CSW claims. Why It Matters: Telegram CEO Pavel Durov, in a statement late Monday, thanked “everyone who reported public channels that crossed the line” in the recent weeks, without mentioning the lawsuit. “Telegram welcomes peaceful debate and protest, but our Terms of Service explicitly prohibit distributing public calls to violence,” Durov said.  “In the last 7 years, we’ve consistently enforced this rule globally, from Belarus and Iran to Thailand and Hong Kong.” Apple, alongside Alphabet Inc. GOOGL GOOG withdrew social media app Parler from their platforms over similar allegations of promoting violence during the Capitol Hill riot. Amazon.com Inc.

381,"Adam Cohen, director of economic policy at Alphabet Inc GOOGL GOOG subsidiary Google defended the company’s ad-sharing agreement with Facebook Inc FB in a blog post over the weekend after detailed revelations related to an antitrust lawsuit filed in December by ten states emerged. What Happened: Cohen dismissed the allegations made by Texas attorney general Ken Paxton — who led in making the disputed claims against the company — as “misleading” and termed the agreement with the Mark Zuckerberg-led company as “well-publicized.” “AG Paxton tries to paint Google’s involvement in this industry as nefarious. The opposite is true,” wrote Cohen. Cohen listed Adobe Inc ADBE, Amazon.com, Inc AMZN, AT&T Inc T, Comcast Corporation CMCSA, Facebook, Oracle Corporation ORCL, Twitter Inc TWTR, and Verizon Communications Inc VZ as competitors in the “famously crowded” online advertising space.  The executive acknowledged Facebook as the largest seller of display ads. He wrote that Amazon surpassed Google last month as the preferred ad-buying platform for advertisers. Google said the Texas attorney general’s claims regarding Facebook’s participation in Google’s Open Bidding program through its Facebook Audience Network were misleading.  “AG Paxton inaccurately claims that we manipulate the Open Bidding auction in FAN’s favor. We absolutely don’t. FAN must make the highest bid to win a given impression,” wrote Cohen. The executive said Open bidding makes up for less than 4% of the display ads Google places. Why It Matters: Cohen’s dismissal of allegations comes after the New York Times published an expose on Sunday containing the details of the Google-Facebook agreement. The Times claimed that Facebook was provided with special information and speed advantages by Google that helped the social media behemoth succeed in auctions to the detriment of other partners — going as far as to include a guaranteed “win rate.” Facebook was said to be testing a new method of selling ads as far back as in 2017 that could undermine Google’s dominance but nearly 2 years later it backtracked and joined efforts of an alliance of companies backing Google, as per the Times. In December, Paxton and nine other Republican attorneys general filed a lawsuit against Google, accusing it of rigging auctions. A bipartisan coalition of states sued the search engine giant in December alleging monopolistic practices related to the company’s online search business.

383,"Tesla Inc TSLA is routing its Indian foray through Amsterdam, The Netherlands — a move that sets it apart from fellow automakers who have recently marked their entry into the South Asian country, the Economic Times reported Monday. What Happened: The Elon Musk-led company’s move is related to tax benefits on capital gains and dividend payments, as per experts, according to Indian media. The corporate structure would make the automaker's Dutch subsidiary, Tesla Motors, the parent of Tesla Motors and Energy India, as per incorporation documents seen by the Economic Times. “The India-Netherlands treaty stands out because it exempts capital gains from tax where India shares are sold by the Dutch company to a non-Indian buyer,” said Deloitte India partner Rajesh Gandhi, as per Economic Times. “The India Dutch treaty has been seen as a good treaty for capital gains exemption for lower withholding tax on dividend and lower withholding tax on interest, said Sridhar Ramachandran, tax partner at Grant Thornton’s Indian operations, Business Insider reported. Why It Matters: The Indian arm was incorporated — with INR 1.5 million ($20,502) authorized capital and INR 100,000 ($1,367) paid-up capital. The company’s registered address is in Bengaluru in southern India. Tesla’s methods are different from both China’s SAIC and Hyundai Motor Company HYMTF subsidiary KIA Motors — relatively recent entrants in the market — which chose to invest in India through their respective home countries, as per the Economic Times.

394,"On Jan. 15, Tesla Inc TSLA launched its Tesla Solar Inverter, and the news sent shares of Enphase Energy Inc ENPH and Solaredge Technologies Inc SEDG tumbling on concerns of new competition. Yet BofA Securities analyst Aric Li said Tuesday that investors should be comfortable buying the dip in Enphase stock. Competitive Risks: One of the biggest risks to the long-term bull cases for both Enphase and SolarEdge is more competition in the module level power electronics space, Li said in a note. The two companies hold about 90% market share of the U.S. residential solar market, the analyst said. Yet the new Tesla inverter is no direct threat to Enphase at this time, he said.  Related Link: Edward Jones Initiates Coverage On Tesla: 'EV Leader, But Competition Increasing'  “Critically, the new inverter by TSLA is not a micro-inverter, with a lack of other micro-inverter competitors in the market (micro-inverter company SolarBridge, which was acquired by SPWR and later sold to ENPH),” Li said Tuesday. Instead, he said Tesla’s inverter is more similar to SolarEdge’s, although Tesla’s product does not have an optimizer. “Overall, we emphasize much less read-through to ENPH relative to MLPE peer SEDG both from a product and go-to-market perspective.”   The biggest potential impact of rising competition for Enphase could be pricing pressures. Li said he is embedding 7.5% annual price depression into his long-term model for Enphase. BofA has a Buy rating and $250 price target for ENPH stock. Benzinga’s Take: Tesla’s solar business has struggled for years since the company was sued by its shareholders following its SolarCity buyout in 2016. Yet Tesla’s brand has a lot of value among clean energy supporters, so investors with exposure to Tesla’s competitors should keep close tabs on the situation.

Vulcan Value Partners, an exclusive investment vehicle for all public equity investments, published its ‘Large Cap Composite’ third-quarter 2020 Investor Letter – a copy of which can be downloaded here. A gross return of 7% was recorded by the fund for the Q3 of 2020, above its Russel 1000 Value Index benchmark that returned 6.8% but below S&P 500 that returned 8.9%. You can view the fund’s top 10 holdings to have a peek at their top bets for 2021. Vulcan Value Partners, in their  Q3 2020 Investor Letter said that they exited their position in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) when its stock price reached their estimated fair value. NVIDIA Corporation is a global technology company that currently has a $318 billion market cap. For the past 3 months, NVIDIA Corporation delivered a -4.73% return and settled at $514.38 per share at the closing of January 15th. Here is what Vulcan Value Partners has to say about NVIDIA Corporation in their Investor Letter: “NVIDIA Corp. is the dominant supplier of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) worldwide. During the first quarter of 2019, its stock price declined considerably due to the combination of three factors. A capital spending hiatus by cloud providers, the collapse in demand for cryptocurrency mining, along with the end of the product cycle in its most recent gaming chip caused NVIDIA to miss its quarterly earnings estimates. As a result, we were given the opportunity to purchase NVIDIA with a significant margin of safety in March of 2019. NVIDIA’s value grew substantially while we owned it, and we continued to follow our discipline by trimming and adding to the company as its price fluctuated. We exited NVIDIA when its stock price rose close to our estimate of fair value. The combination of its value growth and the closing of the price to value gap provided substantial returns over our investment period.” Iaroslav Neliubov/Shutterstock.com Last November 2020, we published an article telling that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) was in 82 hedge funds’ portfolio. Its all time high statistics is 95. NVDA delivered a huge 106.35% return in the past 12 months. Our calculations showed that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) does not belong to the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds. The top 10 stocks among hedge funds returned 216% since the end of 2014 and outperformed the S&P 500 Index ETFs by more than 121 percentage points. We know it sounds unbelievable. You have been dismissing our articles about top hedge fund stocks mostly because you were fed biased information by other media outlets about hedge funds’ poor performance.

							Haider Saleem						   Stock – Apple  Ticker – NASDAQ: AAPL Sector – Technology Halal – No, but use your own judgment (see full article) Why it’s a buy – Substantial growth over the past 5 years You want to buy Apple stock, but you’re concerned if it is sharia compliant. Let’s take a look at their financial results for its fiscal 2020 fourth quarter ended Sept 26 2020. We’ll use 12 months ended figures rather than the quarterly for a better overall picture. To consider if Apple is Shariah compliant, we will use the following criteria which consist of qualitative and quantitative analysis. They include three financial ratios. We will only apply the criteria/financial ratios in this article. If you want a detailed explanation of what each criteria contains, you can read our stock screening article. We also, have a halal stock screener course where you can access the materials anytime and it goes through step-by-step how to actually screen a stock (it helped me a lot). We’ll also use Apple’s Form 10-K. It makes an interesting read. The form is their annual report that gives a comprehensive summary of a company’s financial performance. Before we begin our analysis, let’s take a look at some of Apple’s highlights. The Fiscal 2020 Highlights include that total net sales increased 6% or $14.3 billion during 2020 compared to 2019, primarily driven by higher net sales of Services and Wearables, Home and Accessories. The weakness in foreign currencies had an unfavorable impact on net sales during 2020. The graph below shows what $100 would have made you on Apple stocks compared to different indices over 5 years. Apple has outperformed them all. What $100 of Apple stock in Sept 2015 would have made you. Now let’s begin to apply our criteria and find out if Apple stocks are halal. Net sales for 2020 were $2,745,150,000 (two billion seven hundred forty-five million one hundred fifty thousand dollars). We need to figure out how much of this is halal. In millions. Sept 2020 figures. Their business is centred around the sales of: There is clear grey area around what part of the business is halal or haram. For example, their Services include digital content (App Store, music, books, etc) and Apple TV+ has haram content. However, we don’t know how much of it is or isn’t haram. The App Store has 1.96 million apps according to Statista – I really don’t fancy sifting through them all. Services make 19.59% of net sales. Services also include their interest-free Apple Card, which is issued by Goldman Sachs. However, it does charge interest on any unpaid monthly amount, with variable APRs ranging from 10.99-21.99%. We at IFG take the view that credit cards are permissible to the extent one does not actually borrow from the credit card company. You can read our views and analysis on credit cards here. However here the question is not whether you can use Apple Card, but whether Apple can benefit from the interest it does charge the unfortunate few who end up needing to pay it. The answer here is definitely not. This is riba plain and simple. Apple also uses derivative financial instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risk on expected, future cash flows, net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries, and certain existing assets and liabilities. Again, not ideal, but we could get comfortable on this if it is solely for practical reasons that a global company like Apple faces (and not speculation). We see no indication that Apple is using derivatives to speculate. There are some concerning ethical issues. One of Apple’s key Chinese suppliers, Lens Technology, which makes iPhone touchscreens, has been accused of using ‘thousands of minority Uighur Muslim people in its factories, forced to work under government “labour transfer” schemes’, as reported in The Times. The owner, who is worth £12bn, declined to comment. The Times article does make a chilling read. Apple has denied these allegations, but it has given “no new business” to the company. Furthermore, last summer, Ofilm, which makes iPhone camera components, was one of the 11 companies added to the US government’s ‘entity list’. The move followed AP reports in March 2020 that said it used Uighur “forced labour”. Apple also denied this. There are also a number of huge fines the company has been recently forced to pay that you can look into. There’s plenty of other ethical issues that I won’t discuss here, but according to ethical consumer, some include: ‘climate change, environmental reporting, habitats & resources, pollution and toxics, arms & military supply, human rights, workers’ rights, supply chain management, irresponsible marketing, anti-social finance, and political activities’. You’ll have to make a judgment yourself. On the business side, it is halal with some haram aspects. We do not know the precise amount of haram income it gets. We also don’t know if it is under 5% of its total income. But given the scale of some of the non-sharia-compliant revenue sources, we would guestimate that it does add up to over 5%. Services in total make 19.59% of net sales – so make of that what you will. On the ethical side, although the Uighur claims are denied allegations, there’s ample evidence in other areas of Apple being unethical, which should make you think hard before investing. However, if it’s a pass for you, let’s move to the next stage. This is the first of the three financial ratios we will use. The total interest-bearing debt should not exceed 33% of total assets. Numbers in millions. Sept 26 2020. We can see ‘Term debt’ is listed under the liabilities and equity section: TOTAL TERM DEBT = $107.44bn We then divide total term debt ($107.44bn) with total assets of the company ($323.888bn) and x 100. $107.44bn/$323.888bn*100 = 33.12%.  Apple is 0.12% over the threshold, therefore fails this step.  However, there is an alternative screening method for step 2, as discussed below. Note: An alternative way of step 2 is to compare interest-bearing debt to market cap – this is preferred by the AAOIFI right now. We divide total term debt ($107.44bn) with the market cap of the company ($2.2t) and x 100. This should be under 33%. $107.44bn/$2.2t*100 = 0.0488363636% It’s clearly under 33% – therefore Apple passes. PASSES under the market cap approach. Ultimately the approach you take on using either the total assets or the market cap depends on the methodology you choose. The scholars are fairly comfortable with either approach – especially in times of market volatility where numbers become abnormal and sharia-compliance thresholds might get triggered a lot as stock market prices seesaw up and down. Our approach has historically been to prefer the total assets approach unless there are compelling reasons for relying on the market cap approach instead. This should be taken on a case by case basis. Let’s go to the final step. Illiquid assets should be at least 20% of total assets. The formula is: Illiquid assets/total assets*100. Numbers in Millions. Sept 26, 2020. Illiquid assets = $180.175bn (their total non-current asset figure). Total assets = $323.888bn Illiquid assets make up 55.63% of total assets, which is greater than 20%. We want Illiquid assets to be 20% or more. Therefore, Apple passes  Note: Goodwill is not specified on the balance sheet which should be included in your calculation.   We at IFG take the view that Apple stock is probably one to be avoided from a sharia-compliance perspective due to the risk of non-sharia-compliant revenue streams. Apple also has a lot of debt, so we would avoid due to that. A summary of our analysis. Some Islamic Investment Companies include Apple in their investment portfolio, such as HSBC Islamic Funds, Wahed Invest and Iman Fund. As you can see from the above analysis, it depends on what screening rules you use on whether or not you deem a particular stock halal or haram. You can compare some funds on our Halal Investment Platform. If you want a detailed explanation of what each criteria contains, then check out our halal stock screener course.  Please note AAOIFI are currently revising their standards, so the above may be subject to change. Please find the AAOIFI standards here. Furthermore, you must screen each stock after new figures are released to ensure there are no changes to permissibility.  If you enjoyed this article, you can follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.

401,"Semiconductor stocks have got off to a strong start in the new year. Following the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2021, an analyst at BofA Securities outlined the key emerging trends that could impact trading in semiconductor stocks. 1. Intel CEO Transition:  Intel Corporation's INTC appointment of industry veteran Pat Gelsinger to enhance technical depth among the top rank is a welcome development, analyst Vivek Arya said in a note. Involvement of an activist investor, robust PC market, positive preannouncement for the fourth quarter and new 10nm product announcements at the CES, as well as the promise of 7nm improvements all led to the 16% year-to-date rally in the stock, the analyst added. However, the CEO transition is unlikely to reverse Intel's market share loss to Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD, non-CPU building blocks including accelerators and DPUs and alternative ARM-based internal chip designs from customers such as Apple Inc AAPL and Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, the analyst said. Intel's manufacturing fixes, including partial outsourcing to Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. TSM, aren't likely to bear fruit before late 2022 or 2023, Arya said.

403,"Tesla Inc. TSLA and Bitcoin (BTC) are more likely to see their values halved than doubled over the period of next 12 months, according to the majority of respondents in a Deutsche Bank survey published Tuesday. What Happened: Deutsche Bank surveyed 627 market professionals last week, with 89% of respondents saying they find some financial markets to be in the bubble territory, as first reported by CNBC. “When asked specifically about the 12 month fate of Bitcoin and Tesla — a stock emblematic of a potential tech bubble — a majority of readers think that they are more likely to halve than double from these levels with Tesla more vulnerable according to readers,” Deutsche Bank said, as per CNBC. The survey respondents rated Bitcoin 10 out of 10 on the bubble scale while U.S. tech stocks overall got a score of 7.9. See also: How to Buy Bitcoin (BTC) Nevertheless, Deutsche Bank noted that survey respondents see “easy monetary situations” as likely to continue through 2021 with the Federal Reserve unlikely to tighten monetary policy before the year is out. Why It Matters: Bitcoin’s spectacular rally saw it hit an all-time high of $41,429.38 on Jan. 8 from trading below the $10,000 level in July last year. The apex cryptocurrency has since cooled-off, trading at around $35,962 at press time. According to JPMorgan analysts, Bitcoin could cross the $40,000 mark again in the coming weeks if investor interest in Grayscale Bitcoin Trust GBTC remains high. If that fails to happen, the cryptocurrency risks further crash. Tesla too has seen a massive 700% over the trailing one-year period, with Elon Musk becoming the world’s richest person — overtaking Amazon.com Inc.’s AMZN Jeff Bezos.  Nevertheless, the EV maker continues to inspire optimistic price targets from analysts, with Wedbush’s Daniel Ives giving a bull case target of $1,250.

Tesla too has seen a massive 700% over the trailing one-year period, with Elon Musk becoming the world’s richest person — overtaking Amazon.com Inc.’s AMZN Jeff Bezos.  Nevertheless, the EV maker continues to inspire optimistic price targets from analysts, with Wedbush’s Daniel Ives giving a bull case target of $1,250.

405,"Apple Inc.’s AAPL electric vehicles could be made by Kia Corp. at the latter’s manufacturing facility in the United States, according to a report from the Korean outlet eDaily. What Happened: Local media reports earlier this month suggested Hyundai Motor Company HYMTF was in advanced discussions with Apple on partnering on the latter's self-driving electric vehicles. Hyundai initially confirmed the reports but later backtracked, saying it was in talks with multiple automakers. According to the latest eDaily report, Hyundai has internally chosen subsidiary Kia to be responsible for making the Apple cars, Apple Insider noted first. If Kia chooses to take control of the project, the company could make the Apple EVs at its Georgia factory in the U.S., the eDaily report says, as per Apple Insider. See Also: Apple Could Be Looking At More Partnerships In EV Quest: Analyst What’s Next: Kia shares spiked as much as 20% on Wednesday in Seoul after the eDaily report. The automaker in a regulatory filing the same day said it was reviewing cooperation on self-driving EVs with multiple foreign firms and didn’t mention Apple.

406,"Ford Motor Company F will have to recall 3 million vehicles due to defective airbags, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Reuters reported Tuesday. What Happened: The federal regulator rejected Ford and Mazda Motor Corporation’s MZDAY petitions centered around avoiding the recall of the dangerous Takata airbags, according to Reuters. The agency said on its website that 2006 Ford Ranger and Mazda B-Series vehicles are at a far higher risk for exploding airbags, which could injure or kill vehicle occupants due to emanating fragments. “These vehicles can and should be repaired immediately,” the regulator said.  Ford said Tuesday that the affected vehicles were subject to an earlier recall for the passenger-side airbag, according to Reuters. See Also: GM To Recall 5.9M Vehicles Over Faulty Airbags As NHTSA Turns Down Petition Why It Matters: Affected vehicles include Ford Ranger, Fusion, Edge, Lincoln, Zephyr/MKZ, Mercury Milan, and Lincoln MKX, noted Reuters. The defect has led to the largest automotive recall in U.S. history — necessitating the refurbishing of 67 million airbags. The inflators have reportedly led to the death of at least 27 people around the world and 18 in the United States and have caused over 400 injuries.  Ford must submit to NHTSA a “proposed schedule for the notification of vehicle owners and the launch of a remedy” within 30 days, as per Reuters. Last week, Tesla Inc TSLA was asked by the regulator to recall 158,000 Model S, X vehicles due to defective touchscreens.

407,"Tesla Inc TSLA is hiring for a remote role that involves addressing social media complaints directed at its CEO Elon Musk. What Happened: The customer service job requires the employee to “provide excellent customer service that is focused on the person as well as the solution,” as per Tesla’s website. The duty specifications earlier called for a candidate that would address “social media escalations directed at the CEO,” Electrek reported. As of press time, this part of the job description had been omitted from Tesla's website. “The role of a specialist is to resolve or escalate complaints through appropriate channels and address social media escalations directed at the CEO with critical thinking. Deliver on Tesla Measures of Excellence, perform other duties and assignments including administrative, special projects,” the job description said, according to Electrek. Why It Matters: Musk is an avid user of Twitter Inc’s TWTR platform and recently disclosed funding the messaging application Signal, a rival to Facebook Inc’s FB WhatsApp.  The entrepreneur’s 42.6 million-strong Twitter following are often witnesses to his antics — such as putting red satin short shorts on sale on the company website. See Also: Musk 'Begs' Twitter Followers To Trash Him On Wikipedia, And Chaos Ensues The social media platform has also been a way for harried customers to reach Musk and have their outstanding issues resolved in the past. Last year, author Nassim Nicholas Taleb complained to Musk about his unpleasant experiences with Tesla’s customer service team regarding an accidental purchase. Taleb was issued a refund later.  Price Action: Tesla shares closed nearly 2.2% higher at $844.55 on Tuesday and fell 0.15% in the after-hours session.

410,"Investors who owned stocks since 2016 generally experienced some big gains. In fact, the SPDR S&P 500 SPY total return in the past five years is 120.4%. But there’s no question some big-name stocks performed better than others along the way. Netflix’s Big Run: One market leader of the past five years was Netflix, Inc. NFLX. In the past decade, Netflix has been one of the top performers in the entire stock market. It's by far the most successful streaming video service in the world. According to eMarketer, Netflix had 168.9 million U.S. subscription video viewers in 2020, more than Amazon.com, Inc.'s AMZN Amazon Prime Video (130.1 million), Hulu (94.5 million), Walt Disney Co's DIS Disney+ (72.4 million) and others. In the past five years, Netflix’s story has shifted away from domestic subscriber growth and third-party content deals toward heavy investment in original content, international expansion and subscription price hikes. Incredibly, Netflix started 2016 trading at just $109. Within weeks of the beginning of that year, the stock hit its low point of the past five years at just $79.95. Netflix returned to the $100 level by mid-2016 and hit $200 for the first time by the end of 2017. The stock topped out at $423.21 in mid-2018 before taking roughly a two-year breather. Investors were concerned about the combination of rising content costs and incoming competition from Disney and others. Related Link: Netflix Reports Q4 Sales Beat, Paid Memberships Up 21.9% YoY Netflix In 2021, Beyond: Netflix shares were once again knocking on the door of $400 when the COVID-19 pandemic hit in early 2020. The stock briefly dipped as low as $290.25 amid broad market weakness before investors began to realize how much a shelter-in-place environment could boost Netflix’s business. The stock soon broke out to new all-time highs, topping out at $575.37 during the summer of 2020 before pulling back to around $500 today. Netflix investors who held on through a volatile few years were rewarded for their patience, and $1,000 worth of Netflix shares bought in 2016 would be worth about $4,786 today. Looking ahead, analysts expect Netflix to continue to march higher in the next 12 months. The average price target among the 37 analysts covering the stock is $580.60, suggesting 16.6% upside from current levels. © 2024 Benzinga.com. Benzinga does not provide investment advice.

413,"Tesla Motors began deliveries to customers of its Model S in June 2012. The car has changed the face of electric vehicles and helped turn Tesla into one of the most well-known brands and stocks. The Stock Or The Car? In June 2012, the 300-mile range version of the Tesla Model S retailed at $77,400. If a customer had chosen to invest in Tesla Inc TSLA — the company rather than the physical car — at that time, they would likely be very happy with the outcome. Related Link: 5 Things You Might Not Know About Elon Musk On June 22, 2012, Tesla’s stock opened at a split-adjusted $6.796. A $77,400 investment would have been good for 11,389 shares of Tesla stock. Holding onto those shares over the next eight-plus years would give a customer the ability to buy many Tesla cars. The value of the 11,389 Tesla shares is $9,409,136 as of Jan. 15. Many Tesla car owners have also invested in the company. The investments in the company over the years have turned Tesla car owners into millionaires along the way.  TSLA Price Action: Tesla shares ended Tuesday's session up 2.23% at $844.55.  Photo courtesy of Tesla. © 2024 Benzinga.com.

414,"U.S. President-elect Joe Biden wants to take his Peloton Interactive Inc PTON bike with him to the White House and some security experts are concerned it poses a potential safety problem, according to the New York Times. What Happened: Pelton's fitness bike is connected to the internet and includes a microphone and camera that could be hacked. But the U.S. Secret Service could be able to take necessary steps to safeguard the connected device from outside threats. Like clockwork, the media seems to love a story about a new security threat entering the White House. In 2016, security experts were concerned that outgoing President Donald Trump's Apple Inc AAPL iPhone poses a threat. Similarly, former President Barack Obama didn't want to part ways with his BlackBerry Ltd BB when he entered the White House. Related Link: Biden's Day One Executive Orders Agenda To Include Health, Equality, Climate Change, Halt Trump Legacy Orders Why It's Important: Security experts may be confident that Biden's Peloton bike poses a very small risk. But, CISO at Cyjax Ian Thornton-Trump told Forbes the job of the Secret Service and other security apparatus in the White House is to mitigate every single risk. ""IoT devices in proximity to, or used by, the President should come under the utmost scrutiny—as I think the key issue here may be covert audio or video surveillance when in use or when idle (and not powered off),"" said Thornton-Trump. What's Next: Biden may be able to keep his bike but at the expense of removing the camera, microphone, and all access points to the internet.

423,"Tesla Inc TSLA is working to develop level five self-driving cars. If successful, it would mean the company is producing vehicles that can fully drive with no human intervention. Other companies are working on thisl, such as General Motors Company's GM Cruise, and Alphabet Inc's GOOG Waymo. One of the less talked about companies working on full autonomy is the Israeli firm Mobileye, which was purchased by Intel Corporation INTC in 2017. The company supplied the hardware used in Tesla's ""Autopilot 1.0,"" Tesla's first advanced driver-assist system. After splitting, Tesla developed a similar self-driving hardware suite.  Both companies rely mostly on cameras, but Mobileye also uses HD Maps and lidar, two things Tesla CEO Elon Musk says are unnecessary to achieve full autonomy.  In a conference covered by ArsTechnica, Mobileye CEO Amnon Shashua discussed the company's full self-driving progress while criticizing Tesla's approach without actually naming the company.  Shashua said one approach is to ""simply record everything from your cameras, and then when you are connected to Wi-Fi, send it to the cloud."" A company could ""deploy a crappy system, call it beta"" and then ""improve and improve and improve,"" he said. Shashua said this strategy is ""one that's likely to ""get into a glass ceiling.""  While Tesla's naming convention has been controversial, it is the most advanced driver-assist tech available to consumers. Some Tesla owners are also using tesla's FSD Beta, which allows the car to fully drive itself from point A to point B, although it still requires driver monitoring and intervention at times.  Photo courtesy of Tesla. © 2024 Benzinga.com.

424,"Mercedes-Benz, the luxury brand owned by Daimler ADR DMLRY, launched Wednesday an all-electric SUV, the EQA, in a bid to meet the regulatory target of having a proportion of emission-free vehicles in its portfolio and also to take on the competitive threat posed by EV leader Tesla Inc TSLA. What Happened:  EQA is the new entry model of the Mercedes EQ family, Marius Philipp, the product manager for the EQA at Mercedes, said in the launch video. It is positioned as a car that meets the demand for urban mobility. The EQA 250 model premiered offers over a range of 420km, according to WLTP. It would come with a 66.5 kilowatt-hour battery pack, with the list price at 39,950 euros ($48,400). The company is also planning a variant with over 500km in range in the future.

Why It's Important:  Europe has been pushing for a ban of fossil fuel vehicles, with some markets in the region targeting a deadline of 2030. Some markest like Norway have witnessed a higher proportion of green energy vehicle sales to total vehicles relative to markets elsewhere. In December, 50% of the cars sold in Norway were EVs. This explains the traditional automakers' push toward EVs. Tesla, meanwhile, has a head start in EV sales by virtue of it being the pioneer, and its mass market vehicle  Model 3  is the best-selling EV in the world.

427,"Tesla Inc’s TSLA California vehicle registrations spiked 63% in the fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis, largely on account of the automaker’s mid-size sports utility vehicle, according to Cross-Sell data, Reuters reported Wednesday. What Happened: Tesla registrations in California — the largest market in the United States — picked up steam as 22,117 vehicles were registered in the three months ended December against 16,200 vehicles in the third quarter, according to Reuters. The Model Y SUV saw 11,417 registrations in Q4. The registrations for the SUV outpaced those for the Model 3 Sedan at 7,044, a yearly decline of 34%. Q4 vehicle registrations in 23 states, where data was available, amounted to 44,749 with the Model Y making up for nearly half of that figure, as per Reuters. Why It Matters: The Elon Musk-led company delivered 499,550 vehicles in 2020, just shy of the 500,000 unit goal set by the CEO.  The automaker has started delivering Model Y vehicles in China, where it has gathered enough orders to exhaust supplies for the first three months of this year.

What Happened: Reportedly, there were no injuries or casualties on the accident site. Tesla’s Shanghai-based unit told in a statement that preliminary analysis suggests that the Model 3 combustion was caused by a damaged battery pack from an impact on the car’s underside.  Yicai Global reports that Tesla is cooperating with the fire department’s investigations and helping the owner with the insurance claim.  It is unknown if the battery-pack was manufactured locally or imported. Chinese battery manufacturer, Contemporary Amperex Technology, told local state media that they did not manufacture the exploded battery pack.

432,"Volkswagen AG VWAGY CEO Herbert Diess made his debut on Twitter Inc’s TWTR platform on Wednesday by taking a dig at Tesla Inc TSLA CEO Elon Musk. What Happened: The executive said that he was on Twitter to make an “impact” and grab some market share. Hello @Twitter! I’m here to make an impact with @VWGroup, especially on political issues. And, of course, to get some of your market shares, @elonmusk – after all, our ID.3 and e-tron have won the first markets in Europe. Looking forward to productive discussions! Diess’s comments assume significance as Volkswagen outpaced Tesla sales in some key European markets such as Norway. Why It Matters: The German automaker’s CEO had admitted in November that the company saw itself in a “race with Tesla.” Diess took a test drive in a Tesla Model Y and called it a “reference” car for automakers in September. Musk too had driven Volkswagen’s ID.3 electric vehicle during a meeting with Diess last year and said that for a “non-sporty car, it’s pretty good.” The best-selling EV in Europe in 2020 was Renault SA’s RNLSY ZOE with 83,000 units sold and an 8% market share. Tesla’s Model 3 was ranked second with 63,000 units sold and a 6% market share. Volkswagen’s ID.3 was ranked sixth but could end up at the number three or four spots, as per InsideEVs. Price Action: Volkswagen OTC shares closed 3.66% higher at $20.94 on Wednesday. On the same day, Tesla shares closed 0.7% higher at $850.45 and gained 0.17% in the after-hours session.

433,"Tesla Inc TSLA CEO Elon Musk is preparing the automaker for a “robust entry” into India, as he seemed to confirm on social media last Wednesday. India, a nation of over 1.37 billion is a comparable market to China, where the company has emerged as a leading purveyor of electric vehicles. Does the Indian market present another golden opportunity for the Palo Alto, California-based automaker? Laying The Groundwork: Last week, the Chief Minister of Karnataka said on Twitter that Tesla would start operations of an R&D unit in the state’s capital Bengaluru, known as the Silicon Valley of India. The preparations to enter India appear to be in full swing and the buzz is apparent even in Singapore where the automaker posted a job ad last Friday for a “Logistics Analyst” fluent in Hindi, a major language spoken in North India, according to local media.  Opportunities Abound: India’s EV market could be worth $206 billion in the next ten years leading up to 2030, according to a study undertaken by India’s Centre for Energy Finance, as reported by the Times of India. As per the study, there is a need for investments of over $180 billion in both vehicle production and charging related infrastructure until the next decade. Cumulative vehicle sales are projected to exceed 100 million units by FY30, a rise of 200x the current size of the Indian market. At the end of March 2020, the number of registered EVs in India was just over 500,000. EV numbers are expected to rise to 14.8 million by 2030, as per CEF. Cars Are Not The Key: Primary problem that Tesla could encounter in India is that, as of now, cars are not the most popular EVs in the country. At the end of FY 2020, there were only 3,400 4-wheeler EVs sold in India, while 150,000 electric two-wheelers were sold, as per CEF data. This is in contrast to China, where, in June, Tesla sold 2,790 Model 3 vehicles in just Shanghai alone. Hyundai Motor Company HYMTF subsidiary Kia Motors which is looking to launch its first EV this year in the global markets might not enter India right after launch due to weak local infrastructure, Tae-Jin Park, chief sales officer of the automaker in India, revealed to Business Insider. Kia's decision comes despite the fact that it has emerged as a dominant player in the Indian market. Still, other EV makers have made some headway, including Tata Motors Limited TTM, which managed to sell 2,529 units of its Nexon EV cornering a 63.2% market share in 2020. MG ZS EV and Hyundai Kona EV sold 1,442 and 223 units respectively, according to Carwale, an Indian automotive portal. Affordability Is The Key: The automaker is expected to enter India with its Model 3 sedan which it is said to have priced at INR 5.5 million ($74,559), as per local media reports. The same vehicle sells for $30,190 in the United States and $38,239 in China. The reason for high prices? Indian duties and taxes. Something even Musk acknowledged in 2019. I’m told import duties are extremely high (up to 100%), even for electric cars. This would make our cars unaffordable. The Numbers Don’t Add Up: The average per capita annual income in India in 2019-20 was INR 126,968 ($1,735.45), as per provisional estimates made by a Government of India ministry, as reported by Hindustan Times. This translates into a monthly per capita income of about $145 and puts a Tesla vehicle beyond the reach of most of the country. The average Chinese on the other hand earned $1,071 per month in Dec 2019, as per data insights firm CEIC — making China a much easier market to sell in for the U.S. automaker. India’s East Asian neighbor is expected to contribute 40% of Tesla’s sales in 2022 as per Wedbush, but India itself could prove to be a much different and timid story.  Government Has A Motive: Tesla’s entry into India comes at a very nascent stage, where the EV landscape is all but barren. India’s government has ambitious plans to install one charging station every 25 km on the country’s highways, Moneycontrol reported. The government also plans to dole out $4.6 billion in incentives to promote the use of EVs and cut its massive oil import bill by $40 billion by 2030. Meanwhile, the government’s tax breaks on batteries are likely to benefit Tesla suppliers Panasonic Corporation PCRFY and Korea’s LG Chem, the Times of India reported separately.  Lessons From The Past: Once upon a time, cars made by the Ford Motor Company F and General Motors Company GM — particularly the Chevrolet brand ruled Indian roads until the 1950s, reported Auto X. These companies had to retreat from India due to government policies and only re-entered the country post liberalization of its economy in 1991. Ford, which re-entered India in 1995 ended independent operations in the country 24 years later in 2019, after failing to get a foothold in the notoriously difficult Indian market. GM’s second foray was much shorter, as the company entered India in 2009 and stopped selling its Chevrolet branded cars in India in 2017.  Expect The Unexpected: While Tesla has decided to step into the Indian market, how long it will last there and if it would find success is very difficult to ascertain. The likelihood of replicating the Chinese success story appears to be slim and Musk & Company could be spreading themselves thin by entering this notoriously hard market. However, if Tesla does find success in India, it would take the perfect storm with all the right conditions in place to make it happen, which include government backing, the right pricing, and a rapid escalation in the average Indian’s income.

434,"Jim Cramer shared his first thoughts on the market Thursday discussing recent earnings and the large number of SPACs. On Procter and Gamble: The recent earnings report from Procter & Gamble Co PG is being undervalued by investors, Cramer said. Procter & Gamble beat earnings per share estimates with a second quarter total of $1.64. Revenue of $19.75 billion beat the estimate of $19.27 billion. “I thought Procter & Gamble was great,” Cramer said. The long-term projections for Procter & Gamble look good with mid-single-digit growth, he added. Investors can add Procter & Gamble to help build a diversified portfolio. “People are yawning at it,"" Cramer said, noting investors would rather own GameStop Corp GME or SPACs. Related Link: PreMarket Prep Stock Of The Day: Procter & Gamble On SPACs: The CNBC host added some cautionary tales for SPACs. While there are some good SPACs, there are too many on the market and some could be bringing bad companies public. “Good money bringing down the rest,” Cramer said. The SPAC process allows companies the chance to hype something for three weeks and get their share price higher. Cramer questioned the companies that are launching more than one SPAC at a time and if they can truly commit their time and dedication to all the ventures they're in. On Intel: Shares of Intel Corp INTC have risen over the last month with news that it's changing to a new CEO. “Intel is pretty static,” Cramer said. He hopes a new CEO can turnaround as they’ve lost their way compared to rivals like Advanced Micro Devices AMD and NVIDIA Corp NVDA: “Intel is full of sound and fury, signaling nothing.” © 2024 Benzinga.com.

The company failed to excite investors in its fourth quarter, which ended Sept. 26, due to weak iPhone sales. But the weakness was likely because people were waiting for the new iPhone 12, which didn't go on sale until October. Wednesday's earnings report will mark the first full season since Apple released its new lineup of iPhones and subscription services bundles. The company's stock was trading above $136 a share, up more than 3% on Thursday morning amid broader market gains. Morgan Stanley analysts said in a note Thursday that they expect a record December quarter. ""Our recent conversations suggest investors expect Apple to release solid, but not great, December quarter results. We disagree and believe that Apple is likely to report all-time record quarterly revenue and earnings,"" the analysts wrote, raising their price target to $152 from $144. ""In our view, the iPhone 12 has been Apple's most successful product launch in the last 5 years."" The firm pointed to strength across Apple's product and services portfolio, driven by 5G adoption, continued remote work and learning and sustained App Store engagement. Analysts added they expect double-digit annual growth for Apple's five revenue segments in the December quarter. ""Overall, our December quarter revenue of $108.2B is 5% above consensus (we are ahead of consensus in every segment but Services), while our EPS of $1.50 is 7% above consensus,"" they said. ""We expect demand strength to continue and our FY21 revenue and EPS estimates are both 5% above consensus."" The firm said Thursday that the stock ""looks delicious,"" and it put its price target of $133 under review. ""As we have stated previously, we believe Apple's first lineup of smartphones on 5G networks are better positioned than investors completely appreciate for the following reasons: 1) carrier support, 2) favorable discretionary income, and 3) 1B working remotely and 1B learning remotely. Further, we attribute the recent strength in shares to investors warming up to this notion,"" DA Davidson analyst Tom Forte wrote. The firm said it will pay attention to iPhone sales trends, comments on privacy and advertising, and potential implications of the new Biden administration. ""We project sales to increase 15.7% to $106,236M, which is above the consensus forecast of $102,563M,"" the firm said. ""Note, Apple did not give formal guidance, but it did expect double-digit growth for all product categories expect iPhone, which it expects single-digit growth. On profitability, we estimate $33,525M of EBITDA (for a 31.6% margin), which is above the consensus figure of $31,763M. Lastly, we project GAAP EPS of $1.52, compared to the consensus estimate of $1.40."" The firm expects Apple to post strong iPhone sales, but said there's little surprise due to a likely strong iPhone 12 cycle. The analysts, including Toni Sacconaghi, raised their first-quarter EPS estimates to $1.53 and FY21 EPS to $4.26 due to higher iPhone average selling prices, a weaker U.S. dollar and strong Mac/iPad sales. ""While our estimates are above consensus, we believe our numbers are relatively in line with buyside expectations,"" the analysts said. ""We expect Apple to provide 'guidelines' rather than 'guidance' for Q2, but are above consensus, likely due to currency, and our expectation for modestly stronger than normal seasonality due to timing of the iPhone 12 rollout."" The firm said it would pay attention to Apple's comments on potential smartphone share gains, ongoing regulatory concerns, and Apple's new services adoption and advertising, but said Apple needs something bigger to outperform expectations. ""AAPL has had a tremendous run, and trades in line with large tech companies with higher growth rates. At 33x consensus 21 EPS, and buyside expectations above the Street's, we struggle to see case for material outperformance in AAPL, absent a surprise product announcement or migration to a bundled hardware subscription model,"" they wrote.

439,"Greenlight Capital hedge fund manager and notorious value investor David Einhorn just released his annual letter to investors, which revealed a record quarter for Einhorn to close out a difficult 2020. Finishing Strong: Greenlight took a massive hit from a large short position in Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) in 2020, but Greenlight finished strong with a 25% gain in the fourth quarter. Despite the disastrous Tesla short position, Einhorn was able to salvage a 5.2% overall gain for the fund for the year. The Greenlight letter disclosed several new long positions heading into 2021, including Fubotv Inc (NYSE:FUBO), Danimer Scientific Inc (NYSE:DNMR) and Neubase Therapeutics Inc (NYSE:NBSE), according to Bloomberg. All three stocks were trading higher by more than 10% on Thursday. Einhorn said the Tesla short position was Greenlight’s biggest loser in 2020, although he reportedly adjusted the position prior to Tesla’s inclusion in the S&P 500. Related Link: Q3 13F Roundup: How Buffett, Einhorn, Ackman And Others Adjusted Their Portfolios 
  Einhorn’s Recent Struggles: Greenlight has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 in recent years as growth stocks have soared and value stocks have lagged. Greenlight reported a 14% net gain in 2019 following a 38% net loss in 2018, its worst year since the fund’s inception in 1996. Einhorn gained mainstream notoriety on Wall Street back in 2007 when he disclosed a short position in Lehman Brothers prior to the bank’s collapse in 2008. However, he had drawn a lot of criticism in recent years for his persistent short position in Tesla and his often heated public communications with Tesla CEO Elon Musk. ""TSLA cars are not a fad; if they were, TSLA would sell many more than it does. The fad is in owning TSLA stock,"" Einhorn said in the letter. As of the end of the third quarter, Greenlight’s three largest long positions were Green Brick Partners Inc (NYSE:GRBK), Brighthouse Financial Inc (NASDAQ:BHF) and Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAWW). Benzinga’s Take: Economist John Maynard Keynes famously said “the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent,” and Einhorn’s performance in recent years highlight just how much of a toll a single short position can take on an entire portfolio when the stock in question gets caught in a potential market bubble. Short positions can result in unlimited theoretical losses, whereas standard long positions are capped at just 100% downside.

440,"Ford Motor Company F shares spiked 6.6% Thursday and are now up 18.6% in the past week following news that Ford electric truck startup Rivian raised more than $2.7 billion at a $28 billion valuation. The Ford news also triggers a flurry of unusually large bullish option trades on Thursday as investors continue to try to position for the next generation of the auto industry. The Ford Trades: On Thursday, Benzinga Pro subscribers received dozens of option alerts related to unusually large Ford trades. These four stood out as some of the largest: Related Link: David Einhorn — Notorious Tesla Short Seller — Just Had His Best Quarter Ever Why It’s Important For Ford Investors: Even traders who stick exclusively to stocks often monitor option market activity closely for unusually large trades. Given the relative complexity of the options market, large options traders are typically considered to be more sophisticated than the average stock trader. Many of these large options traders are wealthy individuals or institutions who may have unique information or theses related to the underlying stock. Unfortunately, stock traders often use the options market to hedge against their larger stock positions, and there’s no surefire way to determine if an options trade is a standalone position or a hedge. In this case, given the relatively large size of the largest trade on Thursday, they could certainly be an institutional hedge. Ford An EV Play? EV stocks have been some of the hottest investments in the market in the past couple of years, with names like Tesla Inc TSLA and Nio Inc - ADR NIO up more than 1,000% in the past 18 months. Ford has been mostly left out of that rally, but investor sentiment may be starting to change now that it’s becoming clear that Rivian is positioned to be a very valuable investment for Ford. Ford has an undisclosed stake in Rivian after investing $500 million in the company at much lower valuation back in April 2019. Benzinga’s Take: Ford has said it's spending more than $11.5 billion in EVs through 2022, yet the stock is down 2.9% overall in the past three years while the share price of minuscule EV companies have soared. Thursday’s call buyers may have sensed Ford investor sentiment is finally starting to turn, and Ford has a long way to go to close the valuation gap with other EV stocks. © 2024 Benzinga.com.

441,"Citron Research editor and notorious short seller Andrew Left joined Benzinga’s ZingerNation Power Hour Thursday to discuss his short thesis on GameStop Corp. GME. Left has recently criticized the valuations of Palantir Technologies Inc PLTR and a handful of high-flying electric vehicle stocks, such as Nio Inc - ADR NIO and Electrameccanica Vehicles Corp SOLO. This week, Left has focused his attention on video game retailer GameStop, which appears to be caught in a massive short squeeze. The stock traded higher by 5.9% on Thursday and is now up 131.2% in the past two weeks despite a lack of major news from the company. Related Link: Crazy GameStop Trading Action Continues: What Traders Need To Know Left’s $20 GameStop Target: Left said he expects GameStop to be back down to the $20 level in the near future. “People just want to buy the stock without even thinking about the business,” Left said. He said he understands people’s fanaticism surrounding Tesla, Inc. TSLA, but GameStop is completely different. “For people that were fanatical about Tesla, I got that. It was a great product, changing the world,” Left said. “But to have a mall-based retailer that’s actually failing, doing poor, trading at all-time highs when it comes to valuation...If you believe they’re going to hit their numbers, they’re trading at next 12 months 42 times EBITDA, and normally it would trade at 4,” he said. Left said the much more successful Best Buy Co Inc BBY is currently trading at around 8 times forward EBITDA. “There’s a high short interest for a reason because their business is pretty much in terminal decline. But nobody wants to hear that. They just want to buy, buy, buy.”  Alternative To GameStop: Left understands the appeal of buying stocks with high short interest, but he prefers to invest in highly shorted stocks that have long-term growth trajectories, like Fubotv Inc FUBO. “GameStop is the opposite,"" Left said. ""So I’m just not understanding why people choose certain stocks to be fanatical about."" He compared the current situation in GameStop to a similar situation in bankrupt Hertz Global Holdings Inc HTCGQ last year. Shares of the heavily-shorted Hertz spiked as high as $6.25 back in June but have since dropped back down to around $1.41. “If you bought GameStop at $10, $20 or $30, congratulations. But at some point you have to say oh, I’ve got to sell this thing in order to make the money,” Left said. Benzinga’s Take: Left always takes a lot of criticism for his missed short calls, led by the WallStreetBets community on Reddit, which is decidedly bullish on GameStop. However, Citron’s annual shareholder letter recently revealed Left had a big year in 2020. Citron’s average exposure for the year was 20% long, and the fund generated a net return of 155% on the year. © 2024 Benzinga.com. Benzinga does not provide investment advice. All rights reserved.

446,"Earlier this week, Tesla Inc TSLA released video from inside its new battery cell manufacturing facility that the company talked about during its battery and investor day. The video showed many impressive machines making hundreds or thousands of battery cells, the current limiting factor in Tesla's supply chain. Come work on cell / battery production at Giga Texas & Giga Berlin! https://t.co/PhsI5bb0uD pic.twitter.com/jEUatMLDmE As covered by Teslarati, it turns out there may be some interesting details to be found in the video. While Tesla is working to make its own battery cells, it is still purchasing from partners and bringing down battery prices. The video shows Tesla's battery factory is highly automated. CEO Elon Musk talked in the past about a fully automated factory to build the Model 3, requiring little to no human interaction. That dream fell through when Musk realized humans were very important. But this battery factory looks like it is moving closer to Musk's initial vision.  Tesla's 4680 battery pack was recently leaked, and these are the cells that will be going into that pack. It seems the battery cells are being created, sorted, and stored in clean rooms, with all of these processes being automated. When compared with typical battery production factories, there are far fewer human workers to be seen in Tesla's video. These advances could help reduce battery and vehicle prices while also relieving some of Tesla's supply constraints. Click here to check out Benzinga's EV Hub for the latest electric vehicle news.

The comments evoked fierce criticism from Prime Minister Scott Morrison who said the country makes rules for “things you can do in Australia.” “People who want to work with that in Australia, you’re very welcome.

451,"Apple Inc AAPL is planning a virtual reality headset that may ultimately lead it to sell augmented reality glasses, Bloomberg reported Thursday. What Happened: The headset with the working name N301 is still in a prototype stage, while the glasses dubbed N421 are at a nascent stage known as “architecture.”  The Tim Cook-led company plans to launch the VR headset as early as 2022 and it will go head-to-head against Facebook Inc’s FB Oculus, Sony Corporation’s SNE PlayStation VR, and others, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg. The glasses on the other hand are still several years away even though a launch in 2023 was previously planned, Bloomberg’s sources revealed. The VR device is said to be expensive and would cost more than rival products. Apple may limit the sale to one headphone per store which by Bloomberg’s calculations — with nearly 500 stores — would cap annual sales at just over 180,000 units. Why It Matters: The Cupertino, California-based company is planning to include its most powerful processors in the headset and the tested chips beat the performance of its M1 Mac silicon, noted Bloomberg.

What Happened: The Palo Alto, California-based automaker’s Model S vehicle got the highest customer rating from owners with 738 points out of a possible 1,000, reported CNet Roadshow on Thursday. The study reportedly spanned battery-electric cars and plug-in hybrids from the model years 2015-2021; just under 10,000 owners participated. Tesla accounted for three spots with its Model 3, Model S, and Model Y vehicles, while Volkswagen AG VWAGY came in the fourth spot with its Audi E-Tron. In the mass-market segment — Hyundai Motor Company's HYMTF Kia took the lead with 782 points, followed by General Motors Company’s GM Chevrolet Bolt EV at 745 points and Hyundai Kona EV at 743 points.  Why It Matters: Despite the presence of some quality concerns, Tesla owners are largely forgiving when it comes to favoring experience over reliability and quality, noted CNet. The Elon Musk-led company had ranked last in the J.D. Power 2020 Initial Quality Study in June.

Typically speaking, contrarian involves going against the grain, either by buying stocks most other investors are selling, or vice versa.  Yet, this exact sentiment towards contrarian investing isn’t necessarily universal. For Schaeffer’s Investment Research, the company has a different approach to contrarian thinking.  “Generally, people are looking for beaten-down stocks, value type of plays, against the trend. However, we look at it from a sentiment standpoint, trading with the broader trend,” said Matthew Timpane, senior market strategist at Schaeffer’s Investment Research. So by looking at stock investment opportunities from a more unqiue sentiment standpoint, here are Schaeffer’s top two contrarian stock picks for 2021. Datadog Inc DDOG is a software and data monitoring company that has seen significant growth over the past year going from $28 during the March sell-off to $103 as of Thursday. But Schaeffer’s still thinks the stock has room to run. One reason they consider this a contrarian call is the tepid growth projections for 2021.  Current analyst projections for DDOG’s 2021 revenue growth sit around 30% versus 62% in 2020. This lowered growth projection is due largely to the expectation that business’ IT spend will be fairly conservative this year. But Timpane believes enterprise spending will likely rebound as we move further away from pandemic mode, which would act as a tailwind. “I expect IT spend will at least recover in 2021, if not expand in the post-vaccine world, as we’ve realized how important technology is to control systematic risk and keep companies operating efficiently in uncertain times,” he said. Timpane also noted DDOG’s recent partnership with Microsoft Corporation MSFT in September as a reason to be bullish, as it will allow both sales teams to cross-sell. Also notable is the company’s increase in consumer product usage.
 
Of Datadog’s customers, about 71% are using two or more products. This number is up from 50% last year. The company also saw a 20% increase in customers who are using four or more products. In the midst of a global pandemic, it comes as no surprise that the healthcare sector experienced significant growth. Medical device maker and genetics company Fulgent Genetics Inc FLGT was no exception, with the company’s stock rising from about $13 to $66 over the last 12 months.  One major contributing factor to this growth was the company’s at-home COVID-19 test kit, which was granted Emergency Use Authorization by the FDA on June 16. But while the stock has risen as much as 1200% since March, Timpane says it is still undervalued relative to its peers. Many analysts currently regard Fulgent’s COVID-19 tests as a temporary catalyst given the current distribution of vaccines across the country. Timpane, however, noted that pandemics are rarely eradicated within one year, and because of that, COVID-19 testing will likely remain a key component of healthcare for the next few years.  “Fulgent is well-equipped to handle the volume though,” said Timpane. “It's expected to outpace rival Co-Diagnostics Inc CODX by up to 30% in total revenues in 2020, and was able to scale its test and up the headcount growth, while still inching margins up by 8%.” Fulgent’s COVID tests aren’t the only reason Schaeffer’s is bullish. The core of Fulgent’s company is its genetic testing division, which more than doubled from 2018 to 2019. This far exceeded the growth rate of other companies in this sector such as InVitae Corp NVTA, Illumina, Inc. ILMN, and Natera Inc NTRA. “This means that even if the coronavirus pandemic becomes quickly under control, Fulgent can still hang its hat on core genetic testing,” Timpane said. “Fulgent offers 18,000 genetic tests, thousands more than the competition.” Photo by Chris Liverani on Unsplash The preceding post was written and/or published as a collaboration between Benzinga’s in-house sponsored content team and a financial partner of Benzinga.

457,"The following post was written and/or published as a collaboration between Benzinga’s in-house sponsored content team and a financial partner of Benzinga. 2020 will go down as a banner year for esports.  In terms of engagement, time spent watching esports on platforms like Amazon.com Inc AMZN-owned Twitch rose to an all-time high last year as gamers sheltered in place.  On Wall Street, investors couldn’t get enough esports either. The VanEck Vectors Video Gaming and eSports ETF ESPO, rose 80% in 2020 and took in over $459 billion in inflows.  That performance was driven by sharp rallies in video game stocks like Activision Blizzard, Inc. ATVI, Take-Two Interactive Software Inc TTWO, and Nintendo NTDOY, all of which made new all-time highs last year.   
2020 performance of ESPO compared to several of the largest U.S. listed video game stocks
Source: Benzinga Pro It seems as if 2020 was the perfect storm for esports. The industry was buoyed by gamers having fewer in-person entertainment alternatives, a continued flow of new title releases, and the release of the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X consoles.  Such enthusiasm has resulted in drastically higher valuations for companies with esports exposure. But the huge run has not made industry experts any less bullish. In fact, there’s a case to be made that the esports story is only just getting started. “The space is experiencing structural long term growth,” said JP Lee, ETF product manager at VanEck. “It's a combination of these big picture trends—people wanting to play video games, interact with their entertainment lives online, cord-cutting, and demographics.” Despite a slight decline in industry revenue in 2020 (mostly as a result of canceled live events) gaming market research firm Newzoo is projecting esports revenue to hit $1.8 billion by 2022. That would represent a nearly 100% increase from 2020.  There are a few factors at play here. The biggest revenue drivers for the industry are expected to be a combination of increased media rights, in-game purchases, and recovering live event sales. Globally, more people watch certain esports events than the Super Bowl, with much of that viewership coming from emerging markets like China, India, Indonesia, and Brazil. This trend also makes esports a demographics play, Lee said.  “I think there is a case to be made that things are a little overvalued right now. But I would say the long term trends are pushing us in a direction where more people are going to be playing video games 10 or 20 years from now than they are today.” According to Lee there are other drivers as well, like the rise of cloud gaming and the continued push towards things like the Metaverse—the virtual reality-enabled universe that will be populated by video games.  “Combined, they make for an exciting future for esports,” he said. “It's as good as it's ever been today, but it's not as good as it's ever going to get.”     Important Disclosures:  This is not an offer to buy or sell, or a recommendation to buy or sell any of the securities mentioned herein.

458,"Tesla Inc TSLA is known for its online buying experience. Customers can visit Tesla's website, pick the vehicle they want, check the boxes of what options they desire, and order their new vehicle. So it shouldn't be a surprise that Tesla is a leader in online sales. Car manufacturers from the U.S., Europe and China had their online buying experiences compared by BearingPoint, a consulting firm. “You need to be where your customers are to understand their needs and preferences. As Tesla convincingly demonstrates, online sales are becoming increasingly important,"" said BearingPoint. While most car manufacturers are selective in which markets they implement an online presence, Tesla is available in all markets studied. The company is not only represented everywhere, but also has the best results. Click here to check out Benzinga's EV Hub for the latest electric vehicle news. Benzinga's Take: It can be argued that despite shutting down factories for weeks, the pandemic helped show Tesla's online sales model is what companies will need going forward. Tesla was able to transition the delivery experience to a touchless one since the online buying model was already underway. © 2024 Benzinga.com. Benzinga does not provide investment advice.

Related Link: BofA Reinstates Coverage Of Cloud Stocks, Names Top Picks For 2021 The Cloud Thesis: The big run in most software stocks has skewed Goldman’s bullish coverage toward attractively valued, high-quality growth stocks, Rangan said in a Thursday initiation note.  Salesforce, Workday and Splunk will likely see improvements in their backlogs and an acceleration of free cash flow growth due to easy year-over-year comps, the analyst said. Goldman is modeling 24% year-over-year FCF growth for Salesforce and 33% FCF growth for Workday in the second half of 2021. In addition, Rangan said the market may be underestimating the potential for Microsoft Azure revenue growth to bounce back after dipping below 50%, boosting the company’s overall margins and profitability. “We believe fundamentals continue to be strong as Digital Transformation catalyzes Cloud adoption and propels the sector, pandemic or not,” the analyst said.  The global cloud services market could be up to seven times larger than it is today in the long-term as more companies digitize their businesses, he said.  Benzinga’s Take: The pandemic rapidly sped up the economic digital transformation by forcing many companies to adapt to a remote working environment. Some companies will likely return to their old way of doing things once the pandemic ends, but the vast majority will not. © 2024 Benzinga.com. Benzinga does not provide investment advice.

462,"A great week for Ford Motor Company F got even better on Friday when the stock got a major upgrade from a big name Wall Street bank. The Ford Analyst: JPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman upgraded Ford's stock from Neutral to Overweight and raised his price target from $11 to $14. The Ford Thesis: Brinkman said Ford’s “incoming tide of hot new products,” including the Mustang Mach-E, the F-160 pickup and the Bronco, will likely drive near-term earnings upside. He said the new F-150 will have the biggest impact on Ford’s financials starting in the second quarter of 2021. “Additional factors working in Ford’s favor are a new CEO laser focused on improving execution, a budding turnaround in China, and the recent bold move to restructure its South American operations, thereby freeing capital for more profitable growth initiatives,” Brinkman wrote in a note. JPMorgan is calling for 2021 Ford EPS of $1.45, well ahead of Wall Street consensus estimates of just $1.02. Related Link: How Option Traders Are Playing Ford Following $2.7B Rivian EV Truck Investment The upgrade comes the same week Ford electric truck investment Rivian raised more than $2.7 billion at a $28 billion valuation. Ford has an undisclosed stake in Rivian after investing $500 million in the company at a much lower valuation back in April 2019. Ford has said it's spending more than $11.5 billion in EVs through 2022. Ford shares are higher by 12% in the past week, but Brinkman sees additional upside ahead for both Ford and General Motors Company GM. Earlier this week, Brinkman reiterated an Outperform rating for GM and raised his price target from $49 to $63. On Friday, Brinkman also raised his price target for Neutral-rated Ferrari NV RACE from $180 to $195 and for Underweight-rated Tesla Inc TSLA from $105 to $125. Benzinga’s Take: EV stocks have been some of the hottest investments in the market in the past couple of years, but Ford has been mostly left out of that rally. However, if Ford investor sentiment is finally starting to turn, the stock has a long way to go to close the valuation gap with other EV stocks. © 2024 Benzinga.com.

473,"Tesla Inc TSLA on Friday sued a former employee over claims of stealing trade secrets. What Happened: The electric-vehicle maker accuses Alex Khatilov of stealing more than 6,000 files of software code. The suit was filed in a U.S. District Court in California. Khatilov is a software engineer who worked at Tesla for under two weeks at the tail end of last year and the beginning of this year. Tesla alleges that he immediately began uploading source code when he took the job. Khatilov says he uploaded files to Dropbox so he could access them on his personal computer and that he didn't know that using Dropbox was prohibited. He says he did not share the files with anyone. Why It Matters: The code is used for back-end business and automation processes that Tesla says could be used by competitors. Tesla has a track record of aggressively going after former employees on grounds of stealing trade secrets. Trade Action: Tesla shares closed at $846.64 on Friday, up 0.2%. © 2024 Benzinga.com.

475,"BlackBerry's Network Operations Center in Waterloo, Canada Shares of Blackberry Ltd. BB are up almost 120% this month as investors have become excited about the company's recent announcements.  What Happened: After Blackberry Ltd phones fell out of style over 10 years ago, the Canadian tech company saw its shares struggle to rebound. Trading at a small fraction of its June 2008 all-time high of nearly $150, a lack of catalysts over the past decade have given investors little to hope for. This year, however, that looks to be changing.  In 2013, CEO John Chen revamped the company to shift its focus from mobile phone handsets to cybersecurity and the Internet of Things. Why It Matters: Chen’s ideas are starting to pay off. Over the last year Blackberry has announced major partnerships with Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, Zoom Video Communication Inc. ZM, Texas start-up OnwardMobility and Huawei.  Blackberry and Amazon: On Dec. 1, Blackberry announced it had partnered with Amazon Web Services to develop and bring to market BlackBerry's Intelligent Vehicle Data Platform, IVY. Automakers will be able to use the software for the smart and autonomous electric vehicles being developed. Blackberry and Zoom: On Oct. 16, Blackberry announced it was partnering with Zoom. Zoom will be using Blackberry’s Blackberry Dynamics cybersecurity software in its mobile platform to protect companies from cyberattacks and data breaches. Blackberry Dynamics software also provides secure video conferencing, which Blackberry says will become more necessary as companies move away from in-person meetings.   Blackberry and Huawei: Earlier this month, it was reported that Blackberry had sold 90 patents to Chinese telecommunications company Huawei. Blackberry holds more patents than any other company in Canada, many that are applicable to smartphones that Blackberry no longer will concentrate on.  Blackberry and OnwardMobility: Despite Blackberry moving away from smartphones, last August Blackberry announced it would be partnering with OnwardMobility to help the tech startup produce Blackberry-branded smartphones with 5G technology. The phones are set to be released in the first half of this year. What’s Next: This year, it looks as though investors are starting to realize the value of what Blackberry has been working on for the last decade as tangible partnerships have been brought to fruition.   One indicator of the growth: Blackberry has posted 116 employment opportunities over the past 30 days for positions available all over the world.  Photo courtesy BlackBerry. © 2024 Benzinga.com.

480,"Every week, Benzinga conducts a sentiment survey to find out what traders are most excited about, interested in or thinking about as they manage and build their personal portfolios. We surveyed a group of over 500 investors on whether shares of Jumia Technologies AG - ADR JMIA will reach $100 by 2022.  Jumia Technologies is a pan-African e-commerce platform that connects sellers with consumers. It includes a logistics service for shipping and delivering packages from sellers to consumers. The company also has a payment service for transactions among participants in selected markets. Jumia directly provides more than 5,000 jobs and many more through the sellers and logistics partnerships.  In a case for future growth, research by Jumia suggests less than 1% e-commerce penetration in Africa versus 12% in the U.S. and 20% in China. Jumia's stock was trading as low as $2.15 in early 2020 and was valued at a few hundred million dollars. After an explosion of growth amid the pandemic, Jumia now trades at around $59 with a market cap of $4.62 billion dollars. It can be said Jumia seeks to become the Amazon.com Inc AMZN of Africa, as the firm attempts to achieve market penetration within Africa similar to that of the FAANG giant. Other e-commerce firms to consider, and who Jumia may choose to model themselves after amid the firm’s rise, include Alibaba Group Holding Ltd - ADR, Shopify Inc SHOP, Wayfair Inc W and Overstock.com Inc OSTK.  Our study revealed 74% of Benzinga traders and investors think Jumia will reach $100 per share by the end of next year. Traders and investors who participated in our study believe shares of Jumia will continue to grow off an increased desire to receive goods via e-commerce delivery services across the African continent, as well as a shared belief that Jumia will eventually be viewed as a tech company first and foremost, and an e-commerce service provider second.

After an explosion of growth amid the pandemic, Jumia now trades at around $59 with a market cap of $4.62 billion dollars. It can be said Jumia seeks to become the Amazon.com Inc AMZN of Africa, as the firm attempts to achieve market penetration within Africa similar to that of the FAANG giant. Other e-commerce firms to consider, and who Jumia may choose to model themselves after amid the firm’s rise, include Alibaba Group Holding Ltd - ADR, Shopify Inc SHOP, Wayfair Inc W and Overstock.com Inc OSTK.  Our study revealed 74% of Benzinga traders and investors think Jumia will reach $100 per share by the end of next year. Traders and investors who participated in our study believe shares of Jumia will continue to grow off an increased desire to receive goods via e-commerce delivery services across the African continent, as well as a shared belief that Jumia will eventually be viewed as a tech company first and foremost, and an e-commerce service provider second.

482,"Dave Portnoy's The Barstool Fund is getting a boost from a Michigan cannabis product company. What Happened: George Sinishtaj, owner of Ooze, a Michigan-based maker of vaporizers and other accessories, says he made a bet of $420,420 on the Buffalo Bills on Friday at Greektown Casino-Hotel's Barstool Sportsbook in Detroit. The casino is matching Sinishtaj's bet and will donate it to the fund, regardless of whether he wins the bet. Greektown said it's the single largest bet ever placed at the casino. Sinishtaj said if he does win the bet, he will donate another $100,000 to the fund. ""Once I saw the casino and Penn were running this promotional, I knew instantly I had to get involved. It's a win-win,"" Sinishtaj said. The promotion is for the casino's parent company, Penn National Gaming, Inc PENN, which last week launched the Barstool Sportsbook app in Michigan. The state gave the go-ahead for gambling apps to go begin operating on Friday, after legalizing internet gambling in 2019. Penn National also is matching first-time deposits that are made and bet on the app this weekend as part of the promotions. Pandemic Relief: The Barstool Fund helps small businesses amid the pandemic. The fund has raised just over $29 million as of Sunday morning.  NFL quarterbacks Aaron Rodgers and Tom Brady, and Tesla Inc TSLA CEO Elon Musk are some of the famous people who have contributed to the fund. © 2024 Benzinga.com.

483,"Microsoft Corporation MSFT likely will beat Wall Street's expectations, and the software giant's cloud computing capabilities around Azure will be a key factor in its success, a Wedbush analyst said on Sunday. What Happened: Wedbush Analyst Daniel Ives has an outperform rating and a $260 price target on Microsoft. Ives says he has seen strong cloud deal activity around Azure, Microsoft's cloud computing service, during the December quarter, and that another Street beat is likely in the cards for MSFT. “We are raising our price target from $260 to $270, while establishing a new bull case of $300 vs. our prior $275 target. We maintain our outperform rating,” Ives said in his report.  Microsoft is expected to report earnings on Tuesday. Why It Matters: According to Ives, the current work-from environment ""is further catalyzing more enterprises to make the strategic cloud shift with Microsoft across the board,"" leading to brisk growth for Azure. “In a nutshell, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and his company continue to lead a transformational cloud story,"" he wrote, that is narrowing the gap with Amazon.com, Inc.

The premium is around 1.9% of the underlying price and the stock is also going to pay a dividend until March, which increases the return for the period to around 2.1%. When these calls expire, he is going to repeat the same process. Wedbush today raised its target on Microsoft.   © 2024 Benzinga.com. Benzinga does not provide investment advice. All rights reserved.

498,"Microsoft Corporation MSFT issued an apology for hiking the price of its Xbox Live Gold subscription service and said it was reversing its decision. What Happened: The Redmond, Washington-based tech giant had last week announced a $1 price hike for a one month Gold membership and a $5 hike for a 3-month membership. The price increase was not meant to affect existing online 12-month or six-month Xbox Live Gold members, Microsoft said in a blog post. The hike would have doubled the cost of an annual pass and a six-month pass would have cost $60. The resulting outrage was evident on Twitter, where one user said, “Damn [I] might switch to play station.” Xbox users gotta sell their Xbox just so they can get Xbox live gold pic.twitter.com/TIYDwg5aFp Microsoft buckled under criticism from its userbase and backpedaled on the prices over the weekend.  “We messed up today and you were right to let us know. Connecting and playing with friends is a vital part of gaming and we failed to meet the expectations of players who count on it every day. As a result, we have decided not to change Xbox Live Gold pricing,” the tech giant said. Why It Matters: Microsoft said it will drop the requirement for a subscription to Xbox Live Gold membership for access to free-to-play games. This is in line with what rivals Sony Corporation SNE and Nintendo Co. Ltd NTDOY offer. The fact you wont need Xbox Live Gold AT ALL to play Halo Infinite Mutiplayer (Or any F2P game) is huge. I'm so glad Microsoft listened to the community on this one. pic.twitter.com/iD3CzSG8E9 The company said price changes would not affect Xbox Live Gold members and they would stay at the current price for renewal. New and existing members can obtain Xbox Live Gold for the same price they pay today, which in the United States is $9.99 for one month, $24.99 for 3-months, $39.99 for 6 months, and $59.99 for 12-months. Price Action: Microsoft shares closed nearly 0.4% higher at $225.95 on Friday and gained 0.33% in the after-hours session.  Read Next: Wedbush Raises Target As It Predicts Cloud Services Will Lift Microsoft Above Wall Street Estimates © 2024 Benzinga.com.

499,"Alphabet Inc GOOGL GOOG self-driving unit Waymo’s CEO John Krafcik dismissed Tesla Inc TSLA as a competitor in an interview with Germany's Manager Magazin. What Happened: “For us, Tesla is not a competitor at all,” Krafcik told Manager Magazin.  “We manufacture a completely autonomous driving system. Tesla is an automaker that is developing a really good driver assistance system,” Business Insider reported, citing the interview. The executive claimed that Waymo’s sensor setup is “orders of magnitude better.” “It is a misconception that you can just keep developing a driver assistance system until one day you can magically leap to a fully autonomous driving system,” Krafcik said, as per Business Insider. Why It Matters: The auto executive said that the “costs for the technology are greatly overestimated” in the case of Waymo, Forbes reported. Krafcik said the costs of owning one of Waymo’s vehicles were comparable to a moderately equipped Daimler AG DDAIF made Mercedes S-Class sedan. That vehicle costs nearly $180,000 in the United States, as per Forbes. Waymo utilizes LiDAR technology in its vehicles.  Last year, Waymo had said its autonomy strategy was “orders of magnitude more advanced” than the competition — in a jibe apparently aimed at Tesla. This month, Waymo said it would stop referencing the term “self-driving” and instead use more “deliberate language” in relation to its technology and call it “fully autonomous driving tech” to distinguish itself from other companies that use the term. Musk said this month that even if the cost of lidar sensors became zero, Tesla would not utilize them.  Price Action: On Friday, Alphabet Class A shares closed 0.45% higher at $1,892.56 and Class C shares closed nearly 0.5% higher at $1,901.05. On the same day, Tesla shares closed 0.2% higher at $846.64 and gained 0.1% in the after-hours session.

501,"Ford Motor Company’s F all-electric F-150 is the more popular choice among buyers in the United States than Tesla Inc’s TSLA Cybertruck, according to research by Cox Automotive. What Happened: The study based on 155 in-market consumers was published last week and concluded that three in five consumers found the F-150 pickup truck appealing — which Cox attributed to familiarity. The respondents were shown images of each vehicle, without brand and model indicators and minus product details. Ford was popular among those surveyed in terms of appeal, winning over 59% of the respondents. General Motors Company GM Hummer Electric Vehicle took second place at 41%. Amazon.com, Inc AMZN and Ford-backed Rivian came ahead of Tesla at 39%. The Elon Musk-led automaker’s Cybertruck came in at the last spot at 19%.  In terms of consideration, Ford led the pack at 45%, with three-quarters of respondents likely to consider the vehicle. Tesla came in second at 32%, Hummer at 28%, and Rivian at 25%. “Tesla and Rivian R1T scored well with younger buyers, and Rivian performed well among female buyers as well,” said Vanessa Ton, senior manager, Cox Automotive. Why It Matters: The non-traditional look of the Tesla Cybertruck didn't impress potential buyers, according to the study. Price, performance, design, and size matter the most to potential EV truck customers, while the brand name and work use were the least important. “Ford leads in every attribute except tech advanced, where Hummer and Rivian are nearly tied for the lead,” according to Cox Automotive. See Also: Ford's Electric F-150 Coming In 2022, Over-The-Air Updates Planned Tesla was ranked the lowest among important attributes that matter the most to pickup truck shoppers, as per the study.

503,"Apple Inc AAPL supplier Luxshare Precision Industry Co said it is under investigation for patent infringement, Reuters reported Monday (Shanghai Time). What Happened: Luxshare said in a regulatory filing that it had been informed of two notices issued by the United States International Trade Commission related to a Section 337 investigation field against it by Amphenol Corporation APH, according to Reuters. Amphenol — a Connecticut-based manufacturer of interconnect products — reportedly filed the complaint last month, alleging that certain electric components imported into the U.S. from Luxshare infringe on its patents for connector cables. The concerns over the patent infringement sent Luxshare stock plummeting 9.5% in Shanghai on Monday. Why It Matters: The China-based Luxshare makes connector cables for both the iPhone and Macbook products of Apple and also manufactures Airpods. Last year, reports emerged that the Tim Cook-led tech giant had advised Luxshare to emerge as a more potent supply rival to Taiwan’s Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. Ltd HNHPF — better known as Foxconn. Luxshare acquired two iPhone assembly plants from Taiwan’s Wistron Corporation in 2020, which unnerved some Foxconn executives, as per Reuters. Price Action: Apple shares closed nearly 1.6% higher at $139.07 on Friday and gained 0.93% in the after-hours session.

505,"Lucid Motors is in talks with Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund to build an electric vehicle manufacturing facility in the country, the fund’s Governor Yasir Al-Rumayyan told the Financial Times. The Public Investment Fund had acquired a 67% stake in the EV maker for about $1.3 billion in 2018. Bloomberg had earlier this month reported on the talks to build an EV manufacturing facility near the Red Sea city of Jeddah. Earlier this month, reports also said Lucid was in talks to go public through a merger with one of Michael Klein's special purpose acquisition companies.  Klein’s Churchill Capital Corp IV CCIV SPAC, which is said to be the one in consideration for the merger, has seen its shares soar to more than double since the reports came to light. Lucid is primed to be one of Tesla Inc.’s TSLA foremost competitors. The EV maker late last year unveiled the Lucid Air sedan with pricing that undercuts the Elon Musk-led company’s Model 3 at $69,900 post-subsidies. Al-Rumayyan told FT that the fund is also in talks with SoftBank Group Corp's SFTBY Vision Fund portfolio companies to bring their presence in the kingdom.

506,"Tesla Inc’s TSLA fourth-quarter results could be “a relative blowout” compared with Wall Street expectations, said Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives Sunday. The Party Is Just Beginning: Ives based his analysis on robust delivery numbers, which have already been reported along with cost efficiency and tax credit “tailwinds.” “It appears the EV party is just getting started,” said the analyst pointing to the robust demand in China for such vehicles. Maintains Tesla Targets: Ives maintained his Neutral rating and  $950 price target on Tesla and said that “after a bull run for the ages Tesla's stock could continue to be range bound until the Street gets a better sense of the growth trajectory for Model 3/Model Y unit volumes for 2021.” The Wedbush analyst kept his bull case target of $1,250 intact. See also: Tesla Gets $1,250 Bull Case Target From Wedbush As EV Market Remains Its World Where Others 'Paying Rent' Expect Robust Tech Season: The analyst is bullish on other tech stocks which as well as the earnings season kicks in.  “In our opinion, despite the historic run we have seen in tech stocks over the past year, there is significant room to run higher as the transformational growth stories in cloud, cyber security, and 5G are just starting to play out in the field,” Ives in a separate note. Microsoft Corp. MSFT and Apple Inc. AAPL also report earnings this week.

First and foremost, with U.S. indices to new all-time highs last week, companies reporting quarterly results this week should be closely watched. We have 120 S&P 500 companies reporting and a few tech names that could move markets; keep an eye on Tesla Inc TSLA, Apple Inc AAPL, Microsoft Corporation MSFT, and Boeing Co BA, to name a few. Last week, the move up was largely led by the Nasdaq and tech strength after NFLX beat expectations; this week we’re seeing somewhat of a mixed start, but it will be interesting to see if tech continues to shine bright. We also have some closely-watched economic data this week like Durable Goods, GDP, more housing data, weekly Jobless Claims, and the Personal Income and Spending data due out Friday will help provide further insight as to what’s happening on the inflation front. Don’t forget about the Fed meeting this week. Investors and traders will be paying close attention to the two-day meeting, which begins Tuesday. Wednesday afternoon we’ll get their decision on rates and bond purchases, and the Q&A session with Fed Chair Jerome Powell will follow. Oftentimes the Fed meeting provides for some good market volatility. Keep an eye on the U.S. Dollar and U.S. Treasuries to see how they respond to the news (or lack of); the Fed is expected to leave rates unchanged and purchases as is. In terms of individual markets to watch, I think crude and copper will be key in the coming weeks to determine how the demand narrative is playing out. Last week the EIA reported the first build in inventories for the new year; if that becomes a trend, it would not be a good sign.

519,"As the economy continues to get hammered by rising Covid cases and additional lockdowns, Microsoft Corporation’s MSFT unique position—with one foot in the “new economy” and the other in the “old”—arguably becomes even more relevant. MSFT, which reports fiscal Q2 earnings Tuesday, is a Tech company whose products might help businesses bridge the gap between old and new. Consider this: “We’re recovering, but to a different economy,” Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said in a recent forum. Then there’s: “The next decade of economic performance for every business will be defined by the speed of their digital transformation.” That’s MSFT CEO Satya Nadella on MSFT’s Q1 earnings conference call back in October. Both basically fit the same theme. The “old” pre-Covid economy isn’t likely to come back. “Digitization or death” looks like it’s here to stay. It’s basically this double-edged sword of opportunity and threat that could keep MSFT demand going up. As MSFT prepares to report, its Azure cloud and Xbox sales are two components investors should consider watching. Both show how MSFT has built its bridge to the digital economy and helps others get there. There’s a reason nearly 90% of Nadella’s opening segment in the last earnings call highlighted MSFT’s suite of cloud offerings: What’s keeping life interesting at the workspace and home is exactly what’s driving MSFT’s revenue. The pandemic shifted Nadella’s strategic “mobile first, cloud first” mantra into high gear, giving the company a boost of pandemic-economy resilience as its segments benefited from the stay-at-home lifestyle. This appeared to help offset weakness in MSFT’s more physical office-oriented demand. MSFT shares took a left hook when it reported fiscal Q1 earnings in October. Analysts generally thought the company’s Q2 revenue guidance ($39.5 billion to $40.4 billion) wasn’t much to write home about. The middle of that range was a bit below the average Wall Street expectation at the time, and Tuesday we’ll see if MSFT was able to exceed it.  FIGURE 1: PLAYING CATCH UP. Although shares of Microsoft (MSFT—candlestick) have recovered since the last earnings report in October, the share price has underperformed the Technology sector (IXT—purple line).  Data sources: S&P Dow Jones Indices, Nasdaq. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results. MSFT’s commercial cloud revenue grew by 31% to $15.2 billion in MSFT’s fiscal Q1, according to CFO Amy Hood, as businesses became reliant on the cloud to maintain productivity. MSFT’s cloud segment comprises Office 365, Dynamics CRM (customer relations management), and its main cloud platform, Azure, which hosts applications and websites. Azure grew 48% in fiscal Q1, accelerating from 47% in the prior quarter. Analysts had expected around 44% growth, CNBC reported at the time. For fiscal Q2, Hood didn’t provide specific guidance for Azure but emphasized that its “revenue growth will be driven by our consumption-based business with continued strong growth on a significant base.” People get caught up in Azure growth every quarter, and that’s not a bad thing. However, it’s not necessarily going to be able to keep up these kind of leaps as its base gets bigger. What’s maybe more important to watch is its market share vs. competitors. In the third quarter of calendar 2020, Azure’s global cloud market share of cloud grew to 19%, according to the data research firm, Canalys. While this was a nice improvement from Q3 2019, when Azure’s market share stood at 17%, its 2020 performance still trails Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, the largest cloud provider. Amazon Web Services (AWS) holds the top spot with a whopping 32% of global market share. There’s arguably plenty of room for growth, especially considering Nadella’s goal to turn Azure into “the world’s computer with more data center regions than any other provider.” That’s a tall order, considering AWS is a more than formidable competitor. MSFT’s earnings conference call might be a good time to hear from executives about any plans to gain additional cloud market share. Stay-at-home orders likely served as a major tailwind for MSFT’s gaming segment. By last October, the company had 15 million Xbox subscribers. Overall, Xbox still finds itself behind fierce competition in Sony Corp SNE and Nintendo. Looking at each company side by side, Sony had sold 113.5 million consoles, dwarfing Xbox One’s 51 million units over the last seven years. Nintendo Switch, starting later in 2017, has already outpaced Xbox, selling 68.3 million units. Given the holiday season and the increasing demand for home gaming consoles amid the pandemic, investors should pay close attention to Xbox Series X and S sales this coming earnings release. MSFT may trail competitor sales in the gaming console space, but it plans to move forward aggressively by making the new Xbox series “the most affordable and the most powerful” gaming console, to use Nadella’s words. In other words, Xbox “pricing” is the strategic linchpin to MSFT’s broadside. Will MSFT succeed in wrestling market share from SNE and Nintendo? We’ll have to wait and see. There are 2.4 billion gamers, according to a June 2020 Statista report. That’s one third of the world’s entire population. As people increasingly adapt to a “work from home” economy, you could argue that home gaming momentum might not only sustain itself but ramp up considerably in the coming months. Although MSFT’s Hood did not provide specific guidance on projected Xbox revenues, MSFT expects to see “revenue growth in the high 20% range” for its entire gaming segment. At the height of the lockdown last spring, MSFT’s gaming units saw a breakthrough in both activity and monetization. Gamers across the world used them to connect, socialize, and play in a fun and non-infectious virtual environment. With lockdowns extending well into 2021, that seems like it might give MSFT more of a tailwind than maybe people had expected. MSFT is scheduled to open its Q2 FY21 earnings book on Tuesday after the closing bell. The company is expected to report adjusted EPS of $1.64 up from $1.51 in the prior-year quarter, according to third-party consensus analyst estimates. Revenue is projected at $40.18 billion, up 8.9% from a year earlier. The options market has priced in an expected share price move of 3.7% in either direction around the earnings release, according to the Market Maker Move indicator on the thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. Looking at the Jan. 29 options expiration, puts have been active at the 220 and 222.5 strikes. Calls have been active at the 230 and 235 strikes. The implied volatility sits at the 18th percentile as of Friday morning. Note: Call options represent the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time. Put options represent the right, but not the obligation, to sell the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time.  In fiscal Q1, MSFT’s adjusted earnings per share were $1.82, above analyst estimates of $1.54, according to Refinitiv. Its revenue of $37.15 billion soared above the $35.72 billion that analysts were expecting. Although shares took a three-day plunge of 6% following lower-than-expected guidance, shares quickly regrouped, now trading up 12% from the lows. Though many analysts believe S&P 500 earnings on the whole fell from a year ago, it appears that a record number of S&P 500 companies have issued positive earnings guidance, a positive trend led by the Information Technology sector. Many Tech stocks have rallied into earnings, feeding impressions that the sector had a nice end to 2020. Some people say last year’s shelter-at-home orders may have permanently changed the face of business and entertainment. This arguably means MSFT has the right “situational” platform where its cloud-based services might prevail. CFRA analysts seem to agree, as the research firm calls the Azure cloud platform MSFT’s primary growth driver. Other business segments to watch as MSFT reports include its legacy Office product suite, LinkedIn ad revenue, and Xbox sales, where CFRA expects growth in demand.

521,"Shares of the electric vehicle maker hit all time highs. It became the most valuable company ever added to the S&P 500 Index (SPX). And, with a little rounding, the company hit its promised target of half a million deliveries.  Because investors tend to closely watch production and delivery numbers, it’s an important milestone that Tesla Inc TSLA said it delivered 180,570 vehicles in the last three months of 2020, bringing the year’s total deliveries to 499,550.  In January 2020, the company said deliveries should “comfortably exceed” that milestone. But investors can probably forgive TSLA for not technically hitting the 500,000 mark given the crazy ride that was 2020, when TSLA had to suspend production in California and China because of the coronavirus.  Looking ahead to TSLA’s Q4 earnings report and conference call after the close Wednesday, investors are likely going to want to hear more details about production, especially after CNBC reported a planned 18-day shutdown of Model S and Model X lines in California. This might suggest the company isn’t seeing as high demand for those older lines as for newer models.  Speaking of newer models, investors are probably champing at the bit to hear more about how Model Y production in China is going. In the January press release announcing the latest production and delivery figures, TSLA also said production of its Model Y had begun in Shanghai. The company said on Twitter Inc TWTR that deliveries of the China-made vehicles started earlier this month. China is an important market for Tesla. As of its Q3 release, it had installed capacity for 250,000 Model 3s at its Shanghai plant. It could be interesting to see how much capacity it says it’s installed there for the Model Y, assuming it releases that data for Q4. Not everything has been smooth for TSLA in the Asian nation. In October, the China State Administration for Market Regulation said TSLA was recalling more than 48,000 S and X models because of potential suspension issues. This month, a Model 3 reportedly caught fire in Shanghai, likely after damage to its battery. That hasn’t been TSLA’s only safety-related headache. Earlier this month, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration asked the electric vehicle maker to recall approximately 158,000 S and X models because of touchscreen display issues.  It could be interesting to see if TSLA leadership thinks that the recall issues are material enough to bring up in their earnings press release or related conference call, and how they might respond to any questions they might get from analysts regarding recalls. TSLA is expected to report earnings after the close on Wednesday. Third-party analysts are eyeing a consensus earnings estimate of $1.00 per share, vs. $0.41 a year ago, on revenue of $10.32  billion—about 39.7% above the quarterly revenue in the year-ago quarter.  The options market has priced in an expected share price move of 4.7% in either direction around the earnings release, according to the Market Maker Move™ indicator on the thinkorswim® platform.  Looking at the Jan 29 options expiration, puts have been active at the 700, 750, and 800 strikes. Higher concentrations have been seen to the upside though, with heavy call volume at the 850 and 900 strikes, even more so at the 1000 strike. The implied volatility sits at the 15th percentile as of Monday morning.  Note: Call options represent the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time. Put options represent the right, but not the obligation, to sell the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time.  Meanwhile, the company seems to be continuing to solidly accelerate as electric vehicles become more popular, not in small part due to TSLA itself. As interest accelerates, TSLA’s competition is heating up too. Notably, Ford Motor Company F and General Motors Company GM have been wading into the EV waters, and their investors apparently view it as a positive thing. That’s a longer term concern for TSLA because F and GM are already accomplished automobile manufacturers with years of experience that they can bring to building EVs. And across the Pacific, recent entrants such as Nio Inc NIO are in TSLA’s rearview mirror and look to be picking up speed.  Still, batteries remain the key ingredient for electric vehicles, and TSLA has a strong position there. So it seems that while other companies are gaining traction in the EV space, a true competition problem may be a while down the road for TSLA. Despite the moat from its battery prowess, as well as a string of profitable quarters, much of TSLA’s valuation has been based on future performance potential rather than current fundamentals.  With a recent price-to-earnings ratio north of 1,600% and a share price that was up nearly 640% in the year through Friday’s close, cautious investors may want to see more about how the fundamentals are shaping up before plunging in at these levels. Perhaps Q4’s earnings report will provide more clarity.  TD Ameritrade® commentary for educational purposes only. Member SIPC. Options involve risks and are not suitable for all investors.

525,"The coronavirus outbreak severely disrupted the stock market and the economy in 2020. While most stocks took a pounding during the COVID-19 sell-off early in the year, many soared to new all-time highs during the market recovery later in 2020.  In 2020, U.S. short sellers logged $345 billion in net in mark-to-market losses, according to S3 Partners analyst Ihor Dusaniwsky. A large portion of those losses came from a handful of heavily shorted stocks that crushed short sellers last year. “The largest losses were in the Consumer Discretionary and Information Technology Sectors while there were minimal profits in the Energy, Real Estate, Financial and Utilities Sectors,” Dusaniwsky said Thursday.

529,"Tesla Inc TSLA is currently developing full self-driving (FSD) vehicles. To do this, the company needs the right combination of hardware and software. In 2016, Tesla began developing its own hardware chips to accelerate its FSD dream, saying the off-the-shelf option wasn't powerful enough. Electrek, citing a report from Korea, has an update on the chip. Tesla's update to the 2016 FSD computer chip is supposedly 5nm, compared to the 14nm of the hardware found in vehicles on the road today. Tesla will be partnering with Samsung to produce the chip, which is the same manufacturer as before. According to Electrek, mass production is slated for the end of 2021, meaning the so-called Hardware 4 (HW4) most likely won't be seen in vehicles until some time in 2022.  Tesla's Model 3 originally came with the older HW2.5. Tesla offered free upgrades to customers to HW3 in order to enable the cars to take advantage of Tesla's FSD software. Some customers are just starting to see the benefits of this with Tesla's FSD Beta software. Click here to check out Benzinga's EV Hub for the latest electric vehicle news.

AAPL
 is scheduled to report earnings after Wednesday’s close. The stock hit a record high of $145/share and is currently trading near that level. The stock is prone to big moves after reporting earnings and can easily gap up if the numbers are strong. Conversely, if the numbers disappoint, the stock can easily gap down. To help you prepare, here is what the Street is expecting: Earnings Preview: Apple Inc. is expected to report a gain of $1.39/share on $102.61 billion in revenue. Meanwhile, the so-called Whisper number is $1.52/share. The Whisper number is the Street's unofficial view on earnings. A Closer Look At The Fundamentals: Fundamentally, both sales and earnings have flat lined in the most recent quarter as the company’s market cap has topped $2.4 trillion! In Q4 2019, the company earned 1.25 and the expectation for Q4 2020 is $1.39 so that should reignite the earnings growth. A Closer Look At The Technicals: Technically, the stock is acting very well and just hit a fresh record high. The stock just broke out of a multi-month base as it continues to flirt with fresh record highs ahead of earnings. Pay Attention To How The Stock Reacts To The News: From where I sit, the most important trait I look for during earnings season is how the market and a specific company reacts to the news.

532,"Apple Inc AAPL, Facebook Inc FB, Microsoft Corporation MSFT, and Tesla Inc TSLA are ready to report record sales this week, along with nearly a quarter of S&P 500 companies scheduled to release their earnings reports. It will also be a busy week, or more precisely a busy Tuesday, for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, with 3M Co MMM, Johnson & Johnson JNJ, American Express AXP and Verizon Communications VZ joining Microsoft as fourth-quarter earnings season gets into full swing. The chip saga continues with Advanced Micro Devices AMD whose shares rose about 5% over the past week. Expectations are high due to its strong fourth quarter results and Intel Corporation's INTC upside guidance that was issued last week. Wall Street expects earnings of $0.47 on revenue of $3.02 billion as it assumes the pandemic made a minimal disruption to its business with positive trends in the data center business and PC sales. AMD has steadily gained market share from Intel in both of these categories. Microsoft will also report after the close, with Wall Street expecting earnings of $1.64 per share on revenue of $40.18 billion. The trends of working and learning from home continue to intensify demands for Microsoft's offerings, as evidenced by the strong Q4 demand. But its biggest strength over the past year has been the commercial cloud business, and Wall Street remains strongly positive about the company's outlook for fiscal 2021 due to Azure's momentum as it's revenue was up 48% on a YoY basis in the previous quarter. This was, however, a slight deceleration from the 50% growth in Q4, and investors will want some evidence that both Azure and Microsoft's Teams that compete against Zoom Video Communications Inc ZM can continue fueling its revenues to new heights. Apple will report after the close, and Wall Street expects earnings of $1.40 per share on revenue of $102.76 billion. The holiday quarter is always a big quarter for Apple and it needs to meet these high expectations, as last year's quarter saw earnings of $1.25 per share on revenue of $88.5 billion. This quarter will be all about sales of the iPhone 12. However, Apple is about more than the iPhone, as its services business now accounts for almost 22% of total revenue. Last quarter, its revenue surged to a new record of $14.5 billion. Facebook will also report after the close with Wall Street expecting earnings of $3.19 per share on revenue of $26.34 billion. Facebook shares had an impressive run over the past week, suggesting that the concerns over digital advertising due to the pandemic have vanished. The social media giant topped consensus earnings expectations in each of the past eleven quarters and has missed earnings estimates just once over the past half of a decade. Yet, over the past year, its shares have been underperforming due to fears of regulatory and political risk. But if it shows a strong surge in daily and monthly active users with upbeat revenue guidance, its stock should be just fine. Tesla will report for the first time since it became part of the S&P 500.

535,"When Tesla Inc TSLA released the Model Y, it came with a new feature that had never been seen in a Tesla vehicle: the heat pump. This replaced the resistive heater, which gave a huge efficiency boost to vehicles in colder climates. Tesla later brought this to the Model 3, also boosting efficiency for that vehicle. Joseph Mardall, the Engineering Director from Tesla that was behind the heat pump, has left the company, CNBC first reported. Mardall was with the company for 10 years but held the role of Engineering Director since April 2018. Mardall and other engineers at Tesla landed on the heat pump idea after working through other HVAC solutions. The heat pump is now being delivered to thousands of vehicles every month. According to his LinkedIn, Mardall will be working at Zipline as the Head of Engineering. His work will involve autonomous drones used to deliver medical supplies.

Our #1 AI Stock Pick is on a steep discount - 29$ instead of 99$! Click here to access exclusive research! A change in administrations is likely to impact the financial markets over the medium to long term. For now, US stock markets are running red-hot courtesy of four years of Trump’s pro-growth economic policies. The pandemic slammed the brakes on the global economy, but US markets rebounded sharply after a lull in Q1 2020. The recent riots notwithstanding, a peaceful transition from Republican to Democrat control has taken place. The Biden administration has wasted no time reversing Trump-era policies with respect to Immigration, the Keystone XL Pipeline, the Paris Agreement, and other special interest subjects. A Democrat-led house, a 50-50 Senate with VP Harris able to cast the deciding vote, and a Democrat incumbent in the White House clears the way for sweeping legislative changes across the board. Already some shifts have taken place in the stock market, particularly with energy stocks as the environmental-friendly approach by Biden has cancelled all permits for the pipeline, as the US looks to alternative sources of energy and foreign oil. The provincial government of Alberta is already feeling the heat, but the blowback is also impacting multiple oil stocks such as Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell, British Petroleum, and a number of ETFs in the energy sector. The Goldman Sachs MLP Energy Infrastructure Fund, in addition to Vanguard’s Energy Fund are both down. Much of the bearish sentiment is unrelated to Biden’s executive orders; it has to do with a precipitous decline in demand owing to the pandemic, and Saudi Arabia’s oil price war. Source: Macrotrends WTI Crude Oil Prices (2012 – 2021) The historical chart for crude oil prices paints an interesting picture between 2016 and 2021. In 2016 the average closing price was $43.29 per barrel for WTI crude, rising to $50.80 per barrel in 2017, and $65.23 per barrel in 2018. In 2019, the average closing price per barrel was $56.99, and in 2020 the price dropped to a multi-year low of $39.68 per barrel. In 2021, the price has risen slightly over the course of the month to $51.95 per barrel. Beyond energy stocks, tech stocks are doing particularly well. There are several stocks to watch including Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Expedia Group Inc (NASDAQ:EXPE), and Luminar Technologies Inc (NASDAQ:LAZR). These stocks have appreciated sharply in recent weeks. Apple Inc is particularly bullish, heading into February 2021. As can be seen from the chart below, the Ichimoku Cloud as a forward-leading indicator is strongly bullish, represented by the green cloud. Prices dipped slightly midway through January, but rose sharply to $139.07 per share (January 22, 2021). The performance of AAPL is similar in many respects to that of other leading tech stocks across the board. Source: StockCharts Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) It is worth pointing out that the Bollinger Bands for Apple are clearly reflective of a retracement to the downside. The upper Bollinger Band is currently at $138.11, the median band is at $131.57, and the lower band is at $125.03. The sharp appreciation in the price of Apple stock is likely to retrace as it reached overbought territory and a sell-off is expected with profit takers. This may reverse the price closer towards the median around $132 per share. The 50-day moving average price of AAPL is $125.58, and the 200-day moving average price is $105.20. The left-to-right price movements have been strongly bullish since Q4 2020. Source: Yahoo! Finance Expedia (NASDAQ: EXPE) Expedia is another example of a tech stock with strong upward momentum. As seen from the above chart, the year-to-date performance of Expedia over the first 4 weeks of January has appreciated from $130.96 to the spot price of $136.52. The 52-week high for Expedia is $147.55, so there has been a retracement in the stock’s price. The short-term, and mid-term performance outlook is bearish, but the long-term outlook is bullish. While Expedia is deemed overvalued, with a -15.49 EPS, and a 1-year target estimate price of $127.96, the steadily increasing price outpaces the long-term moving average (200-day MA $96.30), and the short-term moving average (50-day MA $129.54). Bollinger Bands indicate that the current price is between the median and lower bands of $137.27 and $125.44 respectively. The downside retracement is due to the mini slump in recent days. Source: StockCharts Luminar Technologies (NASDAQ: LAZR) Another tech stock which has shown promise heading into 2021 is Luminar Technologies Inc (NASDAQ: LAZR). The stock was trading flat throughout 2020, and experienced a massive spike between December 2020 and January 2021. The price shot up from under $10 per share to over $47 per share in double-quick time, before speculators sold to take profits. The price steadied around $34 per share, for massive gains in the New Year. Part of the reason why the stock is surging is Tesla. As a laser light and sensor company, Luminar Technologies Inc stock is used in AI vehicles for measuring distances, and is a critical component in self-driving vehicle technology.

542,"Back in December, Tesla Inc TSLA shut down its Model S and X production lines for retooling. Many believed this was so the company could get ready for a highly anticipated interior and exterior refresh of the aging vehicles. Production resumed in early January.  Now Teslarati has spotted what they believe to be the refreshed Model S leaving a test track near Tesla's Fremont factory. Teslarati notes several changes, including a wider body, wider wheels, a new front air intake, a new rear bumper, and modified fog lights.  The exterior of the vehicle does not seem dramatically different from the Model S sold today. Since its debut in 2012, the Model S interior and exterior have remained largely unchanged. To date, the vehicle has received a new nosecone, several different wheels have been offered, and new autopilot camera placements have been made.  Benzinga's Take: The big unknown is the interior. Many speculate the portrait screen will be updated to better match the current Model 3 and Y screen. The Cybertruck, which will be released at the end of the year, was revealed with a 17-inch landscape screen that would be a great fit for the S and X refresh.

544,"Private phone numbers of Facebook Inc FB users are available through a bot on the rival Telegram messaging service for $20 a pop, Vice's Motherboard reported Monday. What Happened: The database contains information on 500 million Facebook users, a person advertising the service told Motherboard. The data is reportedly related to a vulnerability that the Mark Zuckerberg-led company fixed in August 2019.  Vice tested the bot and found that initial results from the Telegram bot are redacted but they can be revealed by buying credits. Each credit is $20 and prices range up to $5,000 for 10,000 credits. Why It Matters: The bot apparently contains information on Facebook users from the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, and 15 other countries. Facebook had more than 2 billion users by 2019 worldwide.  The bot can be utilized by even novice cybercriminals as it is easy to access or by hackers, which can misuse the information, as per Vice. This month Apple Inc AAPL iPhone users were suddenly logged out of their Facebook accounts due to an outage caused by a “configuration change,” as per USA Today. Price Action: Facebook shares closed nearly 1.3% higher at $278.01 on Monday and fell 0.53% in the after-hours session.

Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, said last month that the EV maker's own full-self driving software would get “absurdly good” in the future.  Nio has its own take on autonomous driving called Navigate on Pilot, or NAD, which is powered by its mass-produced mobile computing platform — Adam. Price Action: Xpeng shares closed nearly 3.1% lower at $54.65 on Monday and gained 0.18% in the after-hours session.

555,"HAMBURG, GERMANY - DECEMBER 28: Apple sign of the Apple store is seen on December 28, 2020 in ... [+] Hamburg, Germany.  (Photo by Jeremy Moeller/Getty Images) Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is slated to publish its Q1 FY’21 earnings on January 27, reporting on a quarter that saw the launch of its much anticipated 5G iPhone 12. We expect Revenues to come in at about $100 billion for the quarter, growing by about 9% versus last year, with EPS likely to grow by about 7% to around $1.35 per share. Our estimates are marginally below the consensus. So what are the key trends that are likely to drive earnings? Firstly, Revenues should see a bump driven by strong demand for the 5G iPhones, which saw multiple models remain back-ordered through the holidays. Apple should also see higher average selling prices for the iconic smartphone, as it raised base pricing on the iPhone 12 versus the iPhone 11, while nudging customers toward the more premium iPhone Pro models (priced at $1,000 and up), which appear to be a better value compared to last year. Apple’s Services business is also likely to have had its strongest quarter yet, driven by the App Store. In fact, Apple provided a data point indicating that between Christmas Eve and New Year’s Eve, a total of $1.8 billion was spent on apps, up 27% versus last year. [1] App sales growth over the same period last year was about 16%. That said, Apple’s margins could see some pressure, as the new iPhones are likely to be more expensive to produce compared to last year as 5G components are pricier. Apple stock has rallied by about 65% over the last 12 months, driven largely by anticipation surrounding the 5G iPhones. Apple stock now trades at 33x projected EPS, making it look pricey compared to historical levels. The Q1 FY’21 earnings should give investors a good sense of how the device is faring and could be key to Apple’s stock trajectory in the near-term. See our pre-earnings analysis Apple Earnings Preview: Will Apple Beat Expectations? for more details on Apple’s recent performance and what’s driving its valuation. [12/9/2020] Apple’s Services Will Overtake The iPhone By 2024 Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) Services business is likely to emerge as its most profitable (and valuable) business within the next four years, likely eclipsing even the iPhone – which is seen as one of the most lucrative consumer products of all time. Here’s how we expect this to play out. We expect Services sales to grow at a rate of about 11% a year (down from a rate of 22% each year over the last 4 years) to $81.5 billion in FY’24, driven by the continued growth of the AppStore and subscription services. On the other hand, we expect iPhone Revenues to grow at an average rate of about 5% each year over the next four years to about $167 billion (iPhone Revenue remained almost flat between 2016 and 2020). Now Apple’s services have much thicker margins compared to hardware products. Over FY’20, Apple’s product Gross Margins stood at 31.5% versus about 66% for Services. If we assume that margins remain flat at current levels, Services Gross Profits would stand at about $54 billion in FY’24, compared to about $53 billion for the iPhone. In fact, Operating Profits could actually be much higher for Services, considering that much of Apple’s Services sales come via commissions, with little marketing or development expenses involved. Our dashboard Breaking Down Apple’s Services Revenue estimates the revenue figures for AppStore, Apple Music, Apple TV+, iCloud, Third-party Subscriptions, Licensing, Apple Care, and Apple Pay. However, there are a few caveats. Firstly, Apple’s Service business is quite dependent on fees Google
GOOG
 pays Apple for being the default search engine on its iDevices (an estimated 20% of Services Revenue, and a larger percentage of profits). There’s a possibility that the U.S. Justice Department’s antitrust lawsuit against Google could jeopardize these payments, hurting Apple’s services growth. Secondly, Apple is increasingly investing in content production with services such as AppleTV+ and these offerings could also have lower margins. So what does this mean for Apple stock? Internet services led companies have typically commanded higher valuation multiples compared to hardware plays on account of their thicker margins, and associated platform related lock-ins. However, in Apple’s case, this is likely already baked into its valuation. Apple’s trailing P/E multiple has soared and almost doubled over the past year to levels of around 38x currently – which is in line with other Internet players such as Alphabet. [Updated 11/23/2020] What’s The Impact Of The AppStore Commission Cut? Last week, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) indicated that it would be cutting its commissions on app sales and in-app purchases from 30% to 15% for smaller developers, who earn less than $1 million annually from the AppStore. Apple has been facing significant criticism that its AppStore practices hurt smaller developers and tech giants, including Apple, face increasing scrutiny from regulators regarding their market power. This move should help Apple’s image to a large extent. App analytics company Sensor Tower estimates that about 98% of the developers that pay Apple commissions will benefit. [2] However, will reducing commissions by half impact the performance of Apple’s highly lucrative and fast-growing Services business? After all, the AppStore is estimated to account for roughly a third of Apple’s Services Revenue. Not really. Apple earns a bulk of its AppStore revenue from the largest developers, with Sensor Tower indicating that developers who benefit from this program accounted for under 5% of App Store revenues last year. Moreover, the discounted fee will only apply until developers cross the $1 million threshold, after which Apple will bill them at the higher 30% commission rate. [Updated 8/17/2020] How The Epic Lawsuit Impacts Apple Last week, Epic Games sued Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) for antitrust violations, after its popular Fortnite game was removed from the AppStore shortly after Epic let players bypass Apple’s in-app purchase system, avoiding the 30% commission on sales. Although Apple has had spats with developers in the past, the Epic lawsuit is noteworthy for a couple of reasons. Firstly, the Epic lawsuit comes at a time when tech giants, including Apple, have been facing increasing scrutiny from regulators regarding their market power. Secondly, Apple is more dependent on its Services business than ever before, with hardware growth slowing (profits from Services grew 5x as fast as hardware profits over the first three-quarters of FY’20), and Epic’s lawsuit targets Apple’s commissions, which we estimate are Apple’s single most profitable revenue stream. Apple made roughly about $360 million in commissions from Fortnite over the last two years per Sensor Tower – a relative drop in the bucket for Apple which pulled in $260 billion-plus in revenues last year. [1] However, if Epic sees a favorable judgment, and if Apple is forced to reduce its commissions or change the terms of its AppStore, this is very likely to set a precedent, causing other developers to demand similar terms. So what could be the financial impact of Apple reducing commissions across the board? Apple takes a 30% cut on App sales and subscriptions (15% from the second year of subscriptions) and we estimate that total commission revenues stood at almost $20 billion in FY’19 (out of a total of about $46 billion in Services Revenue). If Apple reduced commissions to say 20% from 30%, it would reduced total commissions by about $7 billion to roughly $13 billion. Although the revenue impact would be limited for Apple (under 3% of Apple’s Total Revenue) the impact on profits would be more pronounced given that commissions are likely to be almost entirely profit. We estimate that Apple’s Operating Income would be about 10% lower if commissions were reduced, considering Apple posted about $64 billion in Operating Income in FY’19. Now commissions of 30% are actually pretty standard across the industry – Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google, which also faces a similar lawsuit from Epic, as well as Microsoft
MSFT
 and Amazon
AMZN
, charge roughly the same fees on app sales on their respective market places. However, Apple has the most to lose from this given the sheer scale of its business. AppStore revenues are roughly twice as large as Google’s Playstore. See all Trefis Price Estimates and Download Trefis Data here What’s behind Trefis?

557,"Apple Inc AAPL reports earnings after the bell on Wednesday, with Zacks estimating EPS at $1.40 and revenue at $102.61B. If Apple beats, or even comes in slightly short, it would mark its first $100B quarter — definitely a milestone. As the 5G smartphone cycle continues to kick off, Apple could continue to benefit, and we could see an all-around great year. The longer work-from-home continues as well, the longer Apple could benefit from increased demand for personal devices like iPads and Macs. Apple’s stock has been trending upwards since April, and the stock has just about doubled since the pandemic hit, making a new all-time high of $145.09 yesterday. Apple has also benefitted from its grouping with the tech mega-caps, FANGM, and saw gains after Netflix Inc’s NFLX earnings report this week. Taken altogether, things are looking great. However, JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPM notes that most investors don’t expect Apple to guide for 2Q, and instead will take the upcoming report as evidence of Apple’s momentum for 2Q and beyond. Will the market get too excited and expect what Apple can’t deliver? Or will Apple keep climbing?  Photo by Laurenz Heymann on Unsplash © 2024 Benzinga.com.

559,"Trying to keep up with all the earnings news? It’s a challenge, but a welcome one for many investors anxious to see how Q4 turned out for the major companies.  The day begins with a fresh batch of earnings data but nothing new on the vaccine front. Johnson & Johnson JNJ had really nice earnings and so did Raytheon Technologies Corp RTX. Meanwhile, Microsoft Corporation MSFT, Texas Instruments Incorporated TXN and Starbucks Corporation SBUX wait in the wings for after the close. There’s so much to look at today it’s hard to keep track of everything.  Some investors might have been hoping for a vaccine update from JNJ as part of its earnings today. Instead, the company promised results, “soon.” With a lot of people worried about new virus variants and slower than expected ramp-up of vaccinations, any positive news on JNJ’s vaccine would probably be welcomed. Looks like we’ll have to wait a bit longer.  We won’t have to wait much longer for the latest Fed observations. They start their meeting today and Chairman Jerome Powell takes the podium tomorrow afternoon. There’s not much drama here. It would be shocking if the Fed said anything other than what it’s been saying about keeping things dovish so the economy can recover. It is the Fed, so you have to pay attention, and of course consider listening for anything they say about possible inflation. Otherwise, it’s probably going to be like sitting through the same movie you just watched. Yesterday, “risk-off” trading dominated. Bonds and volatility rose amid virus worries. Today, bonds stepped back just a bit, crude is holding steady, and markets in Europe rose overnight amid strong earnings over there. That, combined with the morning’s solid set of U.S. earnings reports, might explain the light pre-market gains for some of the major indices.  On the first day of the biggest earnings week of the year, what rallied? Companies that make toilet paper, household cleaners, and canned beef stew. Kimberly Clark Corp KMB, Clorox Co CLX, and Hormel Foods Corp HRL partied like it was 2020 on Monday. At the same time, big-Tech got some bids ahead of Microsoft Corporation MSFT reporting later today and Apple Inc AAPL, Tesla Inc TSLA, and Facebook, Inc. FB going tomorrow.  Basically, the market behaved like everyone would be staying home a while longer, with investors once again embracing the stocks that rocked when lockdowns first hit. Meanwhile, the airlines that had found some buyers last week got sent back to the hangar, with American Airlines Group Inc AAL, Delta Air Lines, Inc. DAL, and United Airlines Holdings Inc UAL suffering sharp losses.  At the same time, bonds also received some new love, pushing the 10-year Treasury yield down to 1.03% by the end of the day after it touched 1.19% earlier this month. Right now, yields might remind you of a turtle that stuck its head out from under its shell, sniffed the air, and then decided it was safer inside. The yield is at its lowest level since Jan. 6.  All this could mean there’s trepidation about the pandemic, especially with Europe facing more trouble and new strains in the U.K. and South Africa. Carnival Corp CCL pushed back cruises. Also, the Biden administration’s decision yesterday to suspend travel to the U.S. from some countries helped reinforce that we’re far from being out of the woods. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) climbed above 24 for a while yesterday after dropping below 22 at times last week, a possible sign of investors fearing more choppiness in the coming days.  The “risk-off” mood might have gained strength by having 20% of the S&P 500 reporting this week and slow progress on vaccinations here. The market’s had an incredible run and many analysts worry things have gotten a little bit priced for perfection. There’s also concern that the Biden administration’s stimulus package might be pushed back on the calendar or trimmed, as it continues to face resistance in Congress. This could have been a factor pressing on some of the cyclical sectors yesterday like Financials and Energy, research firm Briefing.com noted.  Also, when you observe action like we saw in GameStop Corp. GME yesterday, you start to scratch your head a little. The stock more than doubled at one point and trading had to be halted several times for volatility. Like it or not, this is the type of stuff that makes veteran investors think back to the crazy days of 1999 and 2000. GME is up another 14% in pre-market trading.  It’s not too hard to find analysts who believe GME is trading far beyond its fundamentals, and there was talk that Monday’s move might have reflected a “short squeeze.” Sometimes a short squeeze is followed by more buying, which was apparently the case last year with TSLA. It can also indicate lots of people with deep pockets not necessarily investing in a stock, but trading it. There’s nothing wrong with that, but if you’re a long-term investor it’s probably not a great idea to get too deeply involved in these moves. This is not normal activity, and you also have to be careful that when the music stops, so to speak—or when these buyers stop and it becomes like a game of musical chairs—that you’re not the one stuck without a chair and nowhere to turn to sell. The momentum that caused GME to go up can also be the momentum that causes it to go down, very quickly.  Caution is the watchword, for GME and many other stocks that have been making new highs. Earnings could be the time when companies need to offer proof that their high prices are justified by the fundamentals. Looking ahead to this afternoon’s fundamentals, MSFT earnings could go a long way toward starting to tell the broader Tech story. Analysts expect the company’s commercial cloud segment to again be the main driver, with focus as always on Azure, MSFT’s main cloud platform. Azure sales grew 48% in the prior quarter, outrunning Wall Street’s estimates. We’ll see what sort of encore MSFT reports today.  Starbucks Corporation SBUX is a big company reporting after the close that almost gets lost in the shuffle with so many behemoths on the calendar this week. Investors can listen to the SBUX call to get a sense of how the company’s been dealing with various state lockdowns and reopenings. They might also get word on whether its huge international business, especially in China, has started to reflect the bigger economic growth seen there recently. Tomorrow morning get ready for some more big names, including Abbott Laboratories ABT and Boeing Co BA. Boeing’s earnings will be the first for the company since the 737 MAX began flying again. Tomorrow afternoon is the big showdown as TSLA, AAPL, and FB all come to the table after the close. Also, tomorrow brings the close of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting and the latest economic observations from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. If you’re bored Wednesday afternoon, you can’t blame it on the market.  One thing Monday’s quick early reversal from the opening rally might remind people of is how important it is to look at the warning signs when they flash. Bonds and volatility were both higher along with stocks at the start of yesterday’s session. When you see that combination, it often means stocks are on a leash. Consider keeping an eye on 25 for the VIX and 1% for the 10-year Treasury yield. Penetration above that on VIX or below that on yield could be another warning sign to bullish stock market investors.  CHART OF THE DAY: BONDS SPOIL BANKS’ PARTY. The bond market has been climbing recently, taking the 10-year Treasury yield (TNX—candlestick) down to nearly three-week lows. Falling yields can take the starch out of the Financial sector (IXM—purple line), and that’s what apparently happened over the last few days. Data Sources: S&P Dow Jones Indices, CME Group.  Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Not a Bad Problem: Some companies have trouble generating cash flow. Others (very few) have the opposite problem: Too much cash. Apple Inc AAPL, which reports tomorrow, is part of that small crowd. The total cash trove stood at roughly $192 billion at the end of the company’s fiscal Q4. AAPL returned nearly $22 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. Investors can expect to continue to see more of that ahead, according to Loup Ventures, which estimates an additional $73 billion will be returned in coming years. “The challenge is that the company is generating so much net income that the road to net cash neutral is long and slow,” Loup Ventures wrote. “Apple has generated $57.4 billion in net income over the past four quarters and returned $90.2 billion in capital in a most tumultuous of years. “At this pace, it will take the company two to three years to be net cash neutral,” the report added. “In the end, Apple has a good problem when it comes to cash—a gravy train of cash returning to investors, which is not fully appreciated.” Stay tuned. Inflation on Doorstep? Did you hear that knock on the front door? One thing that could eventually show up is a little inflation, especially if there’s another big stimulus. As more money hits the system, at some point one would expect a bit of inflation. Maybe it will be more likely in the second half of the year if we get back to normal and people return to their offices and have other opportunities to spend. A lot of the country is still on lockdown and that means there’s only so much spending people can do. If you’re wondering about sector impact from possible inflation, it’s often thought that Consumer Staples and Utilities tend to do better in an inflationary environment. We’ll get a look this Friday at Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) prices for December. This report, which the Fed closely watches, showed a tepid 1.1% year-over-year rise in November. Home Renovations: If new spending is driving prices higher and causing the recent manufacturing boom showing up in recent statistics, some of it might be happening in the home furnishings and appliances market. People stuck at home tend to spend on their homes, or at least it seems to be the case. It will be interesting to see if this theory gets more backing when Whirlpool Corporation WHR reports this week and Home Depot Inc HD comes out later in the earnings season. Don’t forget Wayfair Inc W, the online furniture retailer whose stock has kind of leveled off recently after that big surge in mid-2020. The company recently raised wages, not a bad sign at all. However, rising wages across more industries could also increase inflation concerns. So far, wage growth has been good but not great. Investors get an update on that early next month when the next payrolls data roll out. TD Ameritrade® commentary for educational purposes only. Member SIPC. Photo by M. B.

561,"Sign In Register A Vancouver company specializing in low-carbon construction material is building up its own access to capital. Nexii Building Solutions Inc. revealed Tuesday (January 26) the close of a funding round that raked in just under $33 million. The latest round, which closed in fall 2020, brings the company’s total funding to $66 million while its valuation now sits at $620 million. In addition to the new capital, Nexii is bolstering its boardroom with the addition of Uber Technologies Inc. (NYSE: UBER) chairman and Apple Inc. (Nasdaq: AAPL) director Ronald Sugar, who had previously joined the advisory board last year. He’ll be joined by Bill McNabb, the former CEO and chairman of The Vanguard Group Inc., who will serve as Nexii’s vice-chairman. “Nexii’s approach to tackling the climate crisis and reinvigorating economies with green technology is exactly where we need to be right now,” McNabb said in a statement. “Facing a global pandemic, devastating hurricanes, fires and floods, amidst a housing crisis with tens of thousands of buildings needing critical retrofitting, we need innovative companies like Nexii to pave the way forward.” The company, which was founded in Moose Jaw before relocating its head office to the West Coast, is known for developing a building material known as Nexiite that can be used as an alternative to cement and concrete for floors, walls and roofs. Starbucks Corp. (Nasdaq: SBUX) and A&W Restaurants Inc. are among the companies that have been tapping Nexiite for the construction of their own buildings. Cement has a large carbon footprint due to its energy intensity. About 900 kilograms of CO2 is produced for every tonne of Portland cement, according to a 2018 study published in Science Direct. Materials that have similar properties as cement, but lower carbon intensities, are being pursued as a way to decarbonize the construction sector. Development of a Nexii production facility is underway in Squamish and the company plans to use the new capital to hasten its opening. In addition to a plant in operation in Moose Jaw, the development of facilities is also underway in Alberta, Ontario and Pennsylvania. Following inquiries from BIV, Nexii revealed funding was raised through a private placement with Fort Capital Partners acting as lead agent.  The offering included participation from Lotus Capital Corp., newly appointed vice-chairman McNabb and Ryan Holmes, the chairman and former CEO of Hootsuite Inc. —With a file from Nelson Bennett [email protected] @reporton © 2024 Business in Vancouver"

564,"Did someone say $100 billion? And then some? Wall Street analysts did. A consensus sees Apple Inc AAPL as joining that rarefied corporate crowd that’s broken the $100 billion in quarterly revenues mark when it opens the books Wednesday on its fiscal Q1.  That’s a record for AAPL, of course, and may have been assisted by holiday sales of its new iPhone 12. But it’s one in a series of fresh peaks AAPL has scored in a year—one the company acknowledged was rocked by adversity in many corners. Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said the strong results in last quarter’s report were driven by “the unmatched loyalty of our customers.” That may or not be true, but when AAPL reports earnings, investors also will be listening to how well AAPL is playing the market share game. The work-from-home trend, fueled by the pandemic, looks like it might have been a game-changer for AAPL, according to Morningstar analysts who believe it powered sales of iPads, desktops, and laptops. All that could be overshadowed in fiscal Q1 by iPhone 12 holiday sales, which it’s probably safe to say will get a fair share of attention Wednesday afternoon following the closing bell. AAPL has always been an attention-getter when earnings season rolls around, and now, with it sporting a $2.34 trillion market cap and reaching new stock price highs, it looks like it’s sure to take a spot under the limelight even when it’s up against a host of other high-profile tech stocks earnings results this week. Tesla Inc TSLA and Facebook, Inc. FB report the same afternoon. Wall Street analysts expect AAPL revenue to jump 12% year-over-year to about $103 billion, according to FactSet. But some firms, such as Loup Ventures, are looking for much stronger numbers: up 19% to $109.5 billion. From an earnings perspective, the Street has reached a consensus of $1.41 a share. Morgan Stanley MS is also forecasting on the high side of consensus, eyeing revenues of $108.2 billion and earnings per share of $1.50. “Our recent conversations suggest investors expect Apple to release solid, but not great, December quarter results,” Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a recent report. “We disagree and believe that Apple is likely to report all-time record quarterly revenue and earnings. “In our view, the iPhone 12 has been Apple’s most successful product launch in the last five years,” they said. More on that later. Any way you look at it, the numbers look robust. AAPL stopped giving guidance last year—kind of like many other companies uncertain of the ramifications of COVID-19 on their sales. In March, no one knew what the ricochet effects of the pandemic might be or how long it might last. We still don’t know all of that, but we have found that the city- and state-mandated quarantines and the overall fear of being in public helped fast-forward many trends that were already picking up steam. The digital transformation sped up, and it looks like AAPL might have been well-positioned for it. While the iPhone 12 might get most of the attention Wednesday, think back to last quarter when CEO Tim Cook noted all-time records for Mac and Services. Though he didn’t offer guidance for this past quarter per se, he did suggest double-digit gains on all product categories except the iPhone 12, which he thought would reach single-digit gains.  FIGURE 1: APPLE LEAVES INDEX IN THE DUST. Over the last year, shares of Apple (AAPL—candlestick) have easily outpaced the Nasdaq-100 Index (NDX—purple line). Apple shares got off to a quick start in 2021, with investors apparently enthusiastic about tomorrow’s Q1 earnings prospects. Data source: Nasdaq. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Despite all the happy talk about fiscal Q4 revenues, iPhone’s weaker-than-expected sales offset the glee and pulled shares down nearly 6% in the first couple of days after the October earnings release. They have since recovered. AAPL reported iPhone sales of $26.4 billion in fiscal Q4, below the $27.73 billion expected by the Street. Much of that shortfall was attributed to AAPL’s decision to push the iPhone 12 launch into this most recent quarter, a move many believe may have led to consumers waiting for the upgrade before they bought. Back then, some analysts said a move to 5G could end up being a tailwind for the iPhone 12 with sales promotions and subscription services bundles. That, combined with the important holiday shopping season about to begin, could have led to a fast start for the new phone. We’ll see now if they were right. Analysts are mostly bullish on their iPhone sales expectations, with some saying the delay might have pushed around $4 billion in iPhone sales to the December quarter from the fiscal Q3. The Street’s consensus last stood at $59.58 billion, up better than 6% on a year-over-year basis. But Loup Ventures thinks that’s conservative. It’s looking for sales to vault 16% on a year-over-year basis to $64.9 billion, jumping to 59% of total sales compared with the iPhone’s typical 50% of sales standing. It’s unclear if that will actually be the case, but if it is it would reverse a trend in recent years toward iPhones being less of AAPL’s total revenue. The company has been emphasizing growth in services. Remember, we’re just two years out from January 2019 when Cook sent a letter to AAPL investors warning of a fiscal Q1 earnings shortfall due in part to weak iPhone sales in China. How things have changed. AAPL is expected to report an adjusted EPS of $1.41, up from $1.25 in the prior-year quarter, according to third-party consensus analyst estimates. Revenue is projected at $103.01 billion, up 16.4% from a year ago. The options market has priced in an expected share price move of 6.2% in either direction around the earnings release, according to the Market Maker Move™ indicator on the thinkorswim® platform.  Looking at the Jan. 29 options expiration, puts have been active at the 125 and 135 strikes. But it’s been dwarfed by activity to the upside, heavy call volume at the 145 and 150 strikes. The implied volatility sits at the 34th percentile as of Tuesday morning.  Note: Call options represent the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time. Put options represent the right, but not the obligation, to sell the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time. The work- and study-from-home phenomenon helped drive sales of Macs and iPads last year, and analysts widely expect that trend continued into the fiscal Q1. A number of bells and whistles were added to new iPads and iPad Airs, and new computers with AAPL’s custom M1 chip replacing the Intel Corporation INTC chip also hit the market. AAPL also is reportedly working on a new iPad Pro expected to be released in mid-March. There’s also talk on Wall Street that AAPL might have patented a new version of the Magic Keyboard for the iPad Pro. Given Cook’s comments about the “most prolific product introduction period,” analysts widely expect to hear about other new products coming on line. An update of the MacBook Air is one of those possible developments. AAPL is working on a thinner and lighter version of the MacBook Air, Bloomberg reported late last week, citing “people with knowledge of the matter. Analysts said they want to know if the planned release in the second half of this year is on track. Analysts at Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co. expect AAPL to shed light on several new products and services, including how sales are going for its $549 AirPods Max over-the-ear headphones and the subscription Apple Fitness+ offering, plus ways to bundle services together for a discount. “In our view, Apple’s portfolio was positioned better-than-ever heading into the recent holiday season, while product and service updates position Planet Apple well in 2021,” the team wrote. Among the myriad reasons AAPL’s earnings are such a magnet goes beyond products Other factors underscoring the company’s progress range from privacy concerns to app developer fees to government interventions and the overall economy. AAPL has done much to address many of these issues, but each quarter tends to introduce a fresh crop. In November, for example, AAPL said it would cut in half the commissions it charges smaller developers who sell software through the App Store and generate under $1 million in sales. AAPL’s original 30% take has long fueled complaints from developers, users and governments over its dominance in the digital world. The price cut to 15% appeased some but not all stakeholders and analysts hope the company will address how the cuts are panning out in the beginning weeks. Another question heading into earnings is AAPL’s cash position. The total cash trove stood at roughly $192 billion at the end of the company’s fiscal Q4, with about $112 billion in debt and a little more than $79 billion in cash. AAPL returned nearly $22 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. Investors can expect to continue to see more of that ahead, according to Loup Ventures, which estimates an additional $73 billion will be returned in coming years.

569,"Last week, EVgo became the latest charging infrastructure company to announce a SPAC deal to go public during a time that is seeing rapid adoption of electric vehicles and infrastructure. About EVgo: Climate Change Crisis Real Impact I Acquisition Corp CLII is bringing EVgo public in a deal that values the company at $2.1 billion. EVgo has over 800 locations for its fast-charging stations in 34 states, including 67 major metropolitan markets. The company has supported over 220,000 customers. EVgo has the largest public DCFC (direct current fast charging) network. The company is a partner with General Motors Company GM, Tesla Inc TSLA, Nissan, Lyft Inc LYFT and Uber Technologies Inc UBER. Charging stations are hosted at retail locations like Albertsons, Wawa and Kroger KR. DCFC is the key that sets EVgo apart from competitors. DCFC made up only 5% of the market in 2019 and is expected to grow share to 40% by 2040. EvGo has 818 DCFC sites and 1,412 charging units. Related Link: 7 Current And Former SPACs That Could Be 2020 Election Plays  Competitors: EVgo is the only charging partner engaged by multiple OEMs to build out the network. A deal with General Motors will see the company add over 2,700 additional fast-charging locations. EVgo also has a deal with Nissan that gives $250 charging credits to customers. The company is also the first charging network with integrated Tesla connectors. Going forward, over 770 connectors are being added to chargers to help Tesla customers. In the electric vehicle charging market, EVgo competes with Blink Charging BLNK, Electrify America, which is owned by Volkswagen VWAGY and ChargePoint, which is merging with SPAC Switchback Energy Acquisition Corp SBE. EVBox Group, which is going public with SPAC TPG Pace Beneficial Finance Corp TPGY, could also soon be a competitor as it seeks to enter the U.S. market. ChargePoint and EVBox both have hundreds of thousands of charging stations. EVgo is the leader in DCFC trailing only Tesla by the number of locations with fast charging stations. Chargepoint had 731 locations as of June, Electrify America had 438 and Blink was part of a combined group that had 140 DCFC. One notable difference between the competitors is an area of concern for EVgo. Despite its lead in the number of DCFC locations, EVgo has less connections than rivals due to an average of 1.7 per location. EVgo’s total of 1,338 ranked behind Electrify America’s 1,807 and ChargePoint’s 1,614. The industry average was 3.8 connections per charging location. EVgo is working on expanding the number of connections per location in the future with future spots having four, six or eight charging connectors. EVgo also prides itself in a 98% uptime rating. Customer satisfaction scores reflect the uptime with EVgo scoring an 8.5 out of 10 for customer satisfaction compared to 8.0 for Electrify America, 7.6 for ChargePoint and 7.0 for Blink Charging. Benzinga’s Take: There could be room for several charging infrastructure stocks to gain on the continued rollout of the additional thousands of stations promised by President Joe Biden. ChargePoint looks like it could be a big winner with its large number of stations and lead in the total number of DCFC connectors. EVgo could be a winner as it works with partners like GM and Tesla to rollout additional DCFC locations and add Tesla connectors going forward. Share Performance: CLII shares have more than doubled since announcing the deal. Switchback shares are up nearly 300% in the last year. Blink Charging shares are up over 2,000% over the last year. © 2024 Benzinga.com. Benzinga does not provide investment advice. All rights reserved.

577,"Facebook Inc FB and Apple Inc AAPL both report earnings Wednesday after the close. Here's a look at the recent stocks' history and how options are pricing the expected move out to this Friday. Apple options are pricing about a 6% move in either direction by Jan. 29 expiration, which captures earnings:  Prior Apple earnings weeks via Options AI Calendar  Facebook options are also pricing about a 6% move in either direction by Jan. 29 expiration, which captures earnings. For this week, that corresponds to about $265 and $300 in the stock.  And the prior Facebook earnings weeks via Options AI Calendar  The Options AI expected move chart helps traders visualize just how much volatility option traders are pricing into stocks like Apple and Facebook and in what timeframe. And when the expected move is large, it follows that buying options can be expensive. So, using Facebook as an example, we look at how spreads can be used to either lower that cost through buying debit spreads or generate income through selling credit spreads and how the expected move can be used to help guide strike selection. Let's consider the scenario where as a trader you are bullish and knowing the expected move to your timeframe, you also believe that the options market is generally correct in its bullish consensus. In other words, the stock is going up, but its likely not going beyond where the market has priced a potential move. In this scenario, rather than simply buying a call option, you might choose to simultaneously sell a higher strike call at the expected move level, creating a debit call spread. This lowers the overall cost (thereby also lowering the breakeven level and increasing probability of profit) in exchange for capping potential upside (beyond where the market has priced the move). Let's look at an example as applied to Facebook. Below is a $15 debit call spread for February 19th, capturing both Demo Day, and earnings, with a breakeven in the stock near $36, and max profit above $42:    Now let's look at an alternative bullish strategy that seeks not to lower cost, but rather to capitalize on higher option prices and generate income by ‘selling to the bears'. Below, we see a $15 wide credit put spread, that could be viewed as essentially ‘mirroring' the debit call spread – in this case selling an at-the-money put option and simultaneously buying a put option at the expected move level (thereby limiting potential downside and defining risk). Note that maximum gain is realized with a move higher in the stock – essentially being bullish by ""selling to the bears"":    Whether a trader chooses a debit or a credit spread might depend on their own level of bullishness, compared to the crowd. The same concepts apply to spreads with a bearish view, with debit spreads to the expected move helping lower costs and lower break-evens and credit spreads risking more to make less, but with a higher probability of profit compared to debits:    Finally, let's consider the scenario where you believe that the options market has overpriced the move and believe that the stock will stay within the expected move on a given timeframe. When ‘selling the move', Premium (or income) received from selling options is kept if the stock stays within a specific range. Here's a look at an Iron Condor for this week's expiration in Apple as an example of a neutral strategy that seeks to collect premium (income) if a stock stays within the expected move.    In this example, the Iron Condor establishes a range of max gain for the trade if AAPL stock closes anywhere between $135 and $152.50 on Friday's expiry. While by no means the only basis for strike selection, setting Condor strikes at the expected move is essentially taking the other side of option market consensus, while retaining the benefits of defined risk/reward. If the stock moves beyond $130 or $157.50, the trade results in a max loss. Remember, the above are just examples of the many ways a trader might express a view using option spreads. They are intended solely to demonstrate how the expected move can provide actionable insight to consider before making any trade, particularly into an uncertain event. Whether gut-checking your own expectations versus the options crowd, generating trade ideas from option market signals, or for more informed strike selection. That's why Options AI puts the expected move at the heart of its chart-based platform. Learn / Options AI has a couple of free tools as well as education on expected moves and spread trading. The concepts shown in Apple can apply to any stock and it is simply used here for illustrative purposes.  The post Facebook, Apple, Earnings and Using Spreads appeared first on Options AI: Learn. © 2024 Benzinga.com.

581,"Apple Inc AAPL is on track to report a bumper quarter, going by the iPhone sales trend. The company is scheduled to release its fiscal-year 2021 first-quarter results Wednesday after the market close. Record Revenues, EPS In Sight: Analysts, on average, estimate Apple to report first-quarter earnings of $1.41 per share on revenues of $103.28 billion. Loup Venture's Gene Munster is above consensus, with the famed Apple analyst estimating 19% year-over-year revenue growth vis-à-vis the 16.70% growth Street is modeling. The company's revenues are expected to top the $100 billion mark for the first time in its history, with the iPhone strength supporting much of the upside. Apple launched its newest iteration of the iPhone, dubbed the iPhone 12, late last year. The company had a delayed, as well as phased, launch of the iPhone 12, which came in four variants. All the four models are 5G enabled. Related Link: 10 Things Apple Investors May Wish For In 2021 Other Metrics:  iPhone builds in the quarter is estimated in the low-to-mid 90 million mark, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said in a note, citing supply chain estimates. Munster sees the share of iPhone revenues to total revenues increasing to 59% in the first quarter from the typical 50% range. He expects iPhone revenues to increase 16% to $64.9 billion compared to the Street estimate of $59.4 billion. Services revenue, which makes up 14% of sales, may have risen 18% year-over-year to $15 billion, the analyst estimates. Munster expects Apple to have exited the December quarter with total cash of $185 billion, comprising $112 billion in debt and $73 billion in net cash. Forward Outlook:  For the March quarter, Apple is expected to report EPS of 91 cents on revenues of $74.54 billion. The consensus estimates for the fiscal year 2021 call for EPS of $4.03 on revenues of $318.9 billion. Munster sees the accelerating digital transformation serving as a tailwind for Apple's revenue growth for the next several years. Ives said Apple has the potential to sell over 240 million units of iPhones in 2021, which could surpass the previous record of 231 million units set in fiscal year 2015. AAPL Stock:  Apple shares ended 2020 with a gain of about 82% at $132.69. Having experienced some weakness at the start of the year, the stock has come back and is trading with a modest gain of 4.8% for the year-to-date period. Apple valuation passed the $2 trillion mark in August, and if the company continues to execute at this pace, a $3 trillion market cap is on the horizon over the next 12 months. Apple shares closed Tuesday's session at $143.16. (Photo by Shiwa ID on Unsplash) © 2024 Benzinga.com. Benzinga does not provide investment advice. All rights reserved.

New Articles Find Your Next Job ! The Texas Supreme Court is set to determine whether Amazon can be considered a “seller,” and thus held liable, for a defective product sold through its website, in the case of McMillan v. Amazon.com, Inc., No. 20-20108, 2020 WL 7417454, at *1 (5th Cir. Dec. 18, 2020), certified question accepted (Jan. 8, 2021). Amazon.com Inc. is the nation’s largest online retailer, selling and shipping millions of products every day. With the COVID-19 pandemic altering shopping habits, Amazon has become even more ubiquitous than ever. While many stores and online retailers struggled in 2020, Amazon’s sales skyrocketed 37% to a record $96.2 billion in the third quarter of 2020. But what happens when a product purchased from Amazon harms a customer? Can Amazon be held liable even if it has no role in designing or manufacturing the product? Courts across the country are grappling with this question, which undoubtedly will impact online retailers like Amazon for years to come. McMillan v. Amazon.com, Inc. involves a young girl who was severely injured after ingesting the batteries from a remote sold on Amazon. The trial court found that Amazon could be held liable for the allegedly defective remote as a seller. Amazon then appealed to the Fifth Circuit, arguing that it was not a seller, but rather only facilitated the sale of the product. The Fifth Circuit declined to hear arguments on the merits, holding, “[g]iven the dearth of on-point caselaw and the significant potential consequences of holding online marketplaces responsible for third-party sellers’ faulty products, we certify this important question to the only court that can adjudicate it with finality: the Supreme Court of Texas.” The Fifth Circuit certified the following question of state law: “Under Texas products-liability law, is Amazon a ‘seller’ of third-party products sold on Amazon’s website when Amazon does not hold title to the product but controls the process of the transaction and delivery through Amazon’s Fulfillment by Amazon program.” The Texas Supreme Court accepted the certified question on January 8, 2021, requesting briefing on the merits. The Texas Supreme Court also set the case for oral argument. The Fifth Circuit is not the only court to address the issue of whether an online retailer can be held liable for defects in the products it sells. Several state and federal courts across the country have issued rulings addressing similar questions. See e.g., Oberdorf v. Amazon.com Inc., 818 F. App’x 138, 143 (3d Cir.), certified question accepted, 237 A.3d 394 (Pa. 2020) (certifying the question of whether Amazon is a seller to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court); Philadelphia Indem. Ins. Co. v. Amazon.com, Inc., 425 F. Supp. 3d 158, 163 (E.D.N.Y. 2019) (“While many courts that initially considered the issue found in Amazon’s favor, some more recent cases have reached different results, with appeals on a few of these cases still pending. Indeed, this is a developing area of law.”). For example, the Ninth Circuit recently heard a case in which an allegedly defective hoverboard injured an Amazon customer. The court ultimately sided with Amazon, affirming dismissal and concluding that Amazon is not a “seller” under the Second Restatement of Torts § 402A as adopted by Arizona state law. State Farm Fire & Cas. Co. v. Amazon.com, Inc., No. 19-17149, 2020 WL 6746745, at *3 (9th Cir. Nov. 17, 2020). However, an intermediate California court of appeal came to the opposite conclusion, holding that Amazon could be held strictly liable for the online sale of allegedly faulty batteries. The court emphasized the critical ability Amazon has to adjust the cost of liability between itself and its third-party sellers and ultimately held that Amazon should be held liable if a product sold through its website turns out to be defective. Bolger v. Amazon.com, LLC, 53 Cal. App. 5th 431, 438–39 (2020). The California Supreme Court denied Amazon’s petition for review, declining to hear the case on the merits. As e-commerce continues to dominate Americans’ shopping preferences, this area of law will continue to develop. Notably, adverse rulings against Amazon will likely encourage potential plaintiffs to file suit, given that Amazon may be considered a “deeper pocket” than the designers and manufacturers of the products it sells. Adverse rulings could also increase the prices consumers pay for products to offset the litigation burden or, alternatively, could lead to fewer available products with Amazon working to limit its liability.

This comes soon after incoming CEO Pat Gelsinger revealed the company's intention to rely big on internal manufacturing for its product line-up leading up to 2023. What Happened:  Intel announced that it has invested $475 million in Intel Products Vietnam, in addition to the $1-billion investment made in the chip assembly and test manufacturing facility in Saigon Hi-Tech Park in 2006. The total investment in the facility now stands at $1.5 billion. A $475-million investment made between June 2019 and December 2020 helped enhance manufacturing of the company's 5G products, Intel Core processors with Intel hybrid technology and 10th-generation Intel core processors, the company said in a statement. Related Link: Why The Best Outcome For Intel Shareholders Is To Break Up The Chipmaker  Why It's Important:  Intel Products Vietnam IPV is the largest assembly and test manufacturing facility in the Intel assembly and test network.

642,"Chamath Palihapitiya joined Scott Wapner on CNBC’s “Halftime Report” to discuss his recent purchase of GameStop Corp GME options.
The so-called ""SPAC King"" was part of a heated exchange with Wapner to discuss the recent run-up in the price of GameStop. Palihapitiya, who purchased calls in GameStop with a strike price of $115, told Wapner he sold the options.
Here are 10 memorable quotes and moments from the CNBC interview. 1. “There is no difference between the retail trader and the billion-dollar hedge fund manager,” Palihapitiya said. “We’re seeing sophistication in retail trading.” 2. The investor added that retail investors have more tools for research than they did before. “You’re really discounting how smart some of these people are,” Palihapitiya said, telling Wapner to spend some time on the WallStreetBets subreddit or on Discord. 3. One of the positives from the GameStop price increase and the rise of the retail trader has been people being able to pay off their mortgages and student loans, Palihapitiya said citing Reddit posts. 4. “This is a joke,” Palihapitiya said when asked if it was irresponsible to be investing in GameStop. 5. The lack of integrity in the system was a precursor to GameStop being over 140% short, Palihapitiya said. 6. Palihapitiya told Wapner retail investors have been hurt before when asked about the hedge funds losing billions of dollars from the GameStop trades. “Retail has been the bagholder before,” Palihapitiya said, referring to owning financial stocks during the financial crisis and time when banks were bailed out by the government. See Also: 'The Little Guy Won': PreMarket Prep Breaks Down The Retail Squeeze, Shorts Running Scared 7. “What happened in GameStop wasn’t a disagreement about fundamental valuation,” he said, noting that this movement was portfolio management arbitrage. 8. “I think that what we’re seeing is a pushback against the establishment.” 9. “Every hedge fund was wrong on Tesla,” Palihapitiya told Wapner when discussing the inaccuracies from hedge funds. Palihapitiya is an investor in Tesla Inc TSLA and said he has his own valuation model for the company that hedge funds are missing. 10. “The retail phenomenon is here to stay.” (Photo: Chamath Palihapitiya by JD Lasica/Flickr) © 2024 Benzinga.com.

644,"Every week, Benzinga conducts a sentiment survey to find out what traders are most excited about, interested in or thinking about as they manage and build their personal portfolios. This week we posed the following question related to semiconductor companies: Over the next year, which stock will have the largest percentage gain? Among respondents to our study, 43% believe shares of AMD will grow the most by the end of 2021. AMD designs and produces microprocessors for the computer and consumer electronics industries. The majority of the firm's sales are in CPUs and GPUs. The semiconductor company said its fourth-quarter revenues came in at $3.24 billion, topping the $3 billion mark for the first time ever.

662,"Tesla Inc. TSLA CEO Elon Musk expressed his disappointment with Discord after the platform took down WallStreetBets from its platform. What Happened: “Even Discord has gone corpo …,” the world’s richest person said in a tweet late Wednesday. Discord had taken down WallStreetBets earlier in the evening, saying the community continued to allow hateful and discriminatory content despite repeated warnings. The company said the action didn’t have any relation to WallStreetBets’ role in the surge of GameStop Corp.’s GME stock. WallStreetBets moderators described the Discord action as “pretty unethical.” “I am not impressed with them destroying our community instead of stepping in with the wrench we may have needed to fix things, especially after we got over 1,000 server boosts,” one of the group moderators said. See also: How to Invest in Tesla Stock The community also went briefly private on Reddit as it looked to ramp up moderation and avoid a similar fate on the platform as Discord. “We've got so many comments and submissions that we can't possibly even read them all, let alone act on them as moderators,” u/zjz, a community moderato, added.

663," The Texas Supreme Court is set to determine whether Amazon can be considered a “seller,” and thus held liable, for a defective product sold through its website, in the case of McMillan v. Amazon.com, Inc., No. 20-20108, 2020 WL 7417454, at *1 (5th Cir. Dec. 18, 2020), certified question accepted (Jan. 8, 2021). Amazon.com Inc. is the nation’s largest online retailer, selling and shipping millions of products every day. With the COVID-19 pandemic altering shopping habits, Amazon has become even more ubiquitous than ever. While many stores and online retailers struggled in 2020, Amazon’s sales skyrocketed 37% to a record $96.2 billion in the third quarter of 2020. But what happens when a product purchased from Amazon harms a customer? Can Amazon be held liable even if it has no role in designing or manufacturing the product? Courts across the country are grappling with this question, which undoubtedly will impact online retailers like Amazon for years to come. McMillan v. Amazon.com, Inc. involves a young girl who was severely injured after ingesting the batteries from a remote sold on Amazon. The trial court found that Amazon could be held liable for the allegedly defective remote as a seller. Amazon then appealed to the Fifth Circuit, arguing that it was not a seller, but rather only facilitated the sale of the product. The Fifth Circuit declined to hear arguments on the merits, holding, “[g]iven the dearth of on-point caselaw and the significant potential consequences of holding online marketplaces responsible for third-party sellers’ faulty products, we certify this important question to the only court that can adjudicate it with finality: the Supreme Court of Texas.” The Fifth Circuit certified the following question of state law: “Under Texas products-liability law, is Amazon a ‘seller’ of third-party products sold on Amazon’s website when Amazon does not hold title to the product but controls the process of the transaction and delivery through Amazon’s Fulfillment by Amazon program.” The Texas Supreme Court accepted the certified question on January 8, 2021, requesting briefing on the merits. The Texas Supreme Court also set the case for oral argument. The Fifth Circuit is not the only court to address the issue of whether an online retailer can be held liable for defects in the products it sells. Several state and federal courts across the country have issued rulings addressing similar questions. See e.g., Oberdorf v. Amazon.com Inc., 818 F. App’x 138, 143 (3d Cir.), certified question accepted, 237 A.3d 394 (Pa. 2020) (certifying the question of whether Amazon is a seller to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court); Philadelphia Indem. Ins. Co. v. Amazon.com, Inc., 425 F. Supp. 3d 158, 163 (E.D.N.Y. 2019) (“While many courts that initially considered the issue found in Amazon’s favor, some more recent cases have reached different results, with appeals on a few of these cases still pending. Indeed, this is a developing area of law.”). For example, the Ninth Circuit recently heard a case in which an allegedly defective hoverboard injured an Amazon customer. The court ultimately sided with Amazon, affirming dismissal and concluding that Amazon is not a “seller” under the Second Restatement of Torts § 402A as adopted by Arizona state law. State Farm Fire & Cas. Co. v. Amazon.com, Inc., No. 19-17149, 2020 WL 6746745, at *3 (9th Cir. Nov. 17, 2020). However, an intermediate California court of appeal came to the opposite conclusion, holding that Amazon could be held strictly liable for the online sale of allegedly faulty batteries. The court emphasized the critical ability Amazon has to adjust the cost of liability between itself and its third-party sellers and ultimately held that Amazon should be held liable if a product sold through its website turns out to be defective. Bolger v. Amazon.com, LLC, 53 Cal. App. 5th 431, 438–39 (2020). The California Supreme Court denied Amazon’s petition for review, declining to hear the case on the merits. As e-commerce continues to dominate Americans’ shopping preferences, this area of law will continue to develop. Notably, adverse rulings against Amazon will likely encourage potential plaintiffs to file suit, given that Amazon may be considered a “deeper pocket” than the designers and manufacturers of the products it sells. Adverse rulings could also increase the prices consumers pay for products to offset the litigation burden or, alternatively, could lead to fewer available products with Amazon working to limit its liability.

667,"Reddit community r/WallStreetBets’ members have been driving a surge in stocks of several companies over the past weeks in what they describe as a fight against short sellers. Heading into Thursday’s pre-market session, stocks of several companies with high short interest continue to see sky-high activity amid the WallStreetBets community. These are the top 10 talked about stocks on the subreddit as of press time, according to official r/WallStreetBets analytics data: GameStop Corp. GME: The video game retailer’s stock has been at the center of the short squeeze. Its stock surged 134.8% on Wednesday alone at $347.51 and is up 1,744% year-to-date. Melvin Capital and Citron Research said they have closed their short positions on GME, but WallStreetBets has dubbed these announcements as attempts at ""manipulation"" and called for members to continue to buy and hold on the GME stock.  According to the New York Times, Melvin investor Point72 has taken a 15% loss over the GME short squeeze. AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. AMC: The movie theater chain which struggled to stay afloat during the COVID-19 pandemic is one of the other prime beneficiaries of the Reddit users-led short squeeze. AMC stock surged a whopping 301% on Wednesday alone at $19.90 but tanked after-hours by 26.6% after WallStreetBets disappeared briefly from Reddit. Nokia Oyj NOK: The veteran Finnish consumer electronics company is seeing the third-highest interest on the subreddit, with users frequently describing its purchase as their move for Thursday. Nokia said in a statement Wednesday it is not aware of any material event that could be causing the rise in its stock price. The company's stock surged 38.48% on Wednesday at $6.55 and is up 67.5% YTD.  BlackBerry Ltd. BB: The once-popular smartphone maker’s stock surged 32.66% on Wednesday to $25.10.

Palantir Technologies Inc. PLTR: Palantir shares surged 10.2% on Wednesday as it too appeared to become the target of WSB short squeeze.  iShares Silver Trust SLV: A Reddit post with 4,000 upvotes dubbed silver bullion market to be “one of the most manipulated on earth.”  “Any short squeeze in silver paper shorts would be EPIC. We know billion banks are manipulating gold and silver to cover real inflation,” the WallStreetBets post says, adding that inflation-adjusted Silver should be $1,000 and not $25. SLV closed 0.97% lower at $23.42 on Wednesday. Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. BBBY The home merchandise retailer’s stock saw a 43.45% uptick on Wednesday despite two analyst downgrades as short squeeze interest remained high. Tesla Inc. TSLA: The electric vehicle maker reported a 46% rise in revenue for the fourth quarter on Wednesday, beating street consensus. The stock dropped 2.14% lower to $864.16 in the regular session. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has expressed support for the WallStreetBets community. First Majestic Silver Corp. AG: The stock surged on similar lines as SLV, with WSB users saying “Silver is probably the most (naked) shorted commodity on earth.” “$AG is essentially $GME for Silver, highest short float in the sector, nice leverage to silver, and just broke out above 10 year resistance too,” a user said in a popular post on the subreddit.

669,"Tesla Inc TSLA CEO Elon Musk said the company’s more than $800 billion valuation is justified as there is a “roadmap” to it. What Happened: Musk’s back of the envelope math revolves around an assumed shipment of $50 or $60 billion worth of vehicles and those vehicles becoming Full Self-Driving and get deployed as robotaxis. The usage of those cars would then jump from 12 hours a week to 60 hours a week, according to Musk.

681,"The two richest people in the world and prominent leaders of publicly traded companies — Amazon Inc AMZN and Tesla Inc TSLA — are engaged in a public fight over the control of satellites. What Happened: SpaceX is working to convince the FCC that its Starlink satellites be moved to lower altitudes. See also: How to Buy Amazon Stock The move is opposed by Amazon and other companies. Amazon said the move by SpaceX is an “attempt to stifle competition.” “We designed the Kuiper System to avoid interference with Starlink and now SpaceX wants to change the design of its system,” Amazon said earlier this week. The company said the move by SpaceX could create a dangerous environment for collisions and increase radio interference. Amazon went on to question why the Starlink satellites need to be moved: “SpaceX has indicated that it is capable of operating its system without exceeding 580 km and has not demonstrated why such a condition should not be effective immediately.” SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk fired back at Amazon: “It does not serve the public to hamstring Starlink today for an Amazon satellite system that is at best several years away from operation,” Musk tweeted Tuesday. Related Link: Amazon To Invest $10B In A Constellation Of Broadband Satellites Compete With Musk’s SpaceX Why It’s Important: Both SpaceX and Amazon are among companies pushing for high-speed internet from space. A big difference for investors here is SpaceX is currently privately held while Project Kuiper is part of an investment in Amazon. Project Kuiper is part of the Aerospace and Satellite Solutions division that is under the AWS division of Amazon. Starlink has over 1,000 satellites in orbit and began beta testing in October. Starlink services cost $99 a month plus $199 in upfront costs for a user terminal and wifi router. Beta testing expanded to the United Kingdom and Canada earlier this month with plans for more international markets coming. SpaceX is planning on spending $10 billion to complete its satellite launches. Estimates say SpaceX could bring in $30 billion annually from its Starlink business or 10x its rocket business. Project Kuiper is planning to launch 3,236 satellites in low Earth orbit to compete with Starlink. The FCC authorized Project Kuiper in July. Amazon has committed to spending $10 billion to build out its satellite plans. Morgan Stanley said the satellite business could be a $100 billion opportunity for Amazon. The battle between Amazon and SpaceX has attracted the attention of others. Amazon’s Project Kuiper has landed critics like Iridium Communications IRDM, Intelsat, Telesat and Hughes Network owned by EchoStar Corp SATS. Benzinga's Take: The impact of the battle and the FCC decision could have an impact on who wins the satellite race for connected internet from space. As a private company, SpaceX is harder for investors to profit from their satellite aspirations. If Project Kuiper can complete its ambitious goals, the Amazon-owned division could add value to the parent company. (Photo: Heisenberg Media, via Wikimedia Commons) © 2024 Benzinga.com.

688,"Square Inc SQ shares traded higher Thursday, and Robinhood restrictions on buying popular WallStreetBets stocks like GameStop Corp. GME and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc AMC could be driving the Square buying. What Happened? The trading restrictions have angered Robinhood users, many of whom have taken to Twitter and other social media platforms to complain. Most other major brokers have also banned buying of these popular stocks. Why It’s Important: Robinhood has branded itself as an anti-Wall Street platform, so backlash against the platform has been quite strong. See also: Robinhood Alternatives Traders may be speculating that many Robinhood users will switch to Square’s Cash App Investing platform as an alternative to Robinhood. Square also reportedly restricted trading in GameStop and AMC on Thursday, but traders fed up with Robinhood may still switch platforms just to make a point. Cash App is geared toward younger, more inexperienced traders, so there is tremendous overlap with the Robinhood user base. Cash App has seen its active user base more than triple in the past two years to about 24 million people. Cash App Investing is a new addition to the app launched in December. Like Robinhood, Cash App Investing has no commissions and is extremely easy to use. Cash app also offers the ability to by fractional shares in high-priced stocks like Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, another perk for small-scale retail investors. Square stock is also a popular investment among Robinhood users according to Robinhood stock ownership metrics that the company stopped making public in the late 2020. SQ Price Action: Square shares were up 8.94% at $220.27 at last check.  Benzinga’s Take: Anthony Denier, CEO of Robinhood competitor WeBull, clearly communicated on Benzinga's ZingerNation Power Hour that WeBull's clearing firm is no longer supporting clearing in GameStop and AMC shares, so their hands are tied. However, Robinhood launched its own in-house clearing system back in 2018, so it cannot simply pass the blame on to a third-party clearing firm. Courtesy photo.  © 2024 Benzinga.com.

696,"The world’s richest man has been against short sellers for some time and continued to share his thoughts on Thursday. What Happened: Tesla Inc TSLA CEO Elon Musk has been sharing thoughts on the recent market volatility led by GameStop GME. Earlier this week, Musk tweeted “Gamestonk!!” and shared the link to the WallStreetBets subreddit. On Thursday, Musk agreed with a user who said shorting should be made illegal. u can’t sell houses u don’t own
u can’t sell cars u don’t own
but
u *can* sell stock u don’t own!?
this is bs – shorting is a scam
legal only for vestigial reasons “Here come the shorty apologists. Give them no respect. Get Short,” Musk tweeted later Thursday night. Musk also agreed with a tweet from U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez calling for more information on Robinhood blocking retail investors from purchasing certain stocks Thursday as hedge funds are freely able to trade the stock as they fit. “Absolutely,” Musk said. Related Link: Tesla Website Crashes As Musk Puts Short Shorts On Sale Why It’s Important: Musk has called out short sellers that have taken on Tesla over the years. It shouldn’t come as a major surprise he's staying vocal in the argument against short selling. At $181 billion, Musk is the richest person in the world and has over 43 million followers on Twitter. The posts from Musk come after Tesla reported record fourth quarter and full-year revenue on Wednesday night. TSLA Price Action: Tesla shares were down 3% to $835.42 on Thursday.

697,"Tesla Inc TSLA Elon Musk has tweeted a digital magazine cover featuring a dog in apparent support of a digital currency Dogecoin. What Happened: Dogecoin, a digital currency that was launched as a joke, has surpassed all-time high today, growing by 420.29% in a matter of one day, according to a data analytics platform CoinMarketCap. The cryptocurrency is currently traded at $0.03831 at the time of publishing. pic.twitter.com/a6kmk0PEgM Musk’s followers recognized the tweet as an endorsement to the current Dogecoin rally, expressing overwhelming support in the Dogecoin future.  Why It Matters: This is not the first time Elon Musk has expressed his interest in the digital currency. See also: Today’s Dogecoin Price In December, Tesla CEO tweeted “One word: Doge” sending the cryptocurrency to a 20% surge. Before that, his July tweet caused a 14% spike in Dogecoin price. CoinMarketCap Head of Listings, however, in a conversation with Benzinga has warned traders about possible ramifications following a call to buy Dogecoin in a Reddit group that caused the recent price spike. ""It bears mentioning that all of this [the spike and the Reddit thread]takes place against a discernible shift in the cultural milieu, one where WSB has become emblematic of a grassroots Reddit movement that seeks to repudiate the entrenched interests and ossified power structures of WallStreet. With his 'Gamestonk' tweet, Elon Musk -- himself the subject of legal entanglements with the establishment (SEC) and erstwhile self-proclaimed Dogecoin CEO -- has not only added rocket fuel to ignite Doge's price action on a SpaceX mission to the moon, but also a offered a familiar face for 'Robinhood traders' to coalesce around.” Read Next: As Elon Musk Touts Dogecoin Again, Here's What You Should Know About The Cryptocurrency Image: missionisgreat via Twitter Learn more about cryptocurrencies © 2024 Benzinga.com.

699,"The interest in meme cryptocurrency Dogecoin (DOGE) is skyrocketing to new heights every hour. According to cryptocurrency market data services provider The Tie, Dogecoin tweet volume has surpassed that of Bitcoin (BTC) over the past 24 hours. Dogecoin tweet volume has surpassed Bitcoin over the last 24 hours.

This is the first time we have on record that an altcoin has been tweeted about more than Bitcoin over a 24 hour period. According to the TIE, there were over 100,000 tweets about Dogecoin in the trailing 24 hours period, to when it tweeted, from 50,000 unique non-bot accounts. The move assumes significance as it is the first time ever that a cryptocurrency has overtaken Bitcoin in terms of the social media spark. Bitcoin (BTC) has a 63.5% dominance of the cryptocurrency market in terms of market capitalization at press time, with a valuation of $634.5 billion.  The second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum, has a market cap of $151.3 billion. Dogecoin is getting a boost from Reddit community SatoshiStreetBets, which is looking to emulate WallStreetBets success with GameStop Corp. GME, AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. AMC and others. Tesla Inc. TSLA CEO Elon Musk too touted the joke cryptocurrency in a tweet late Thursday. Dogecoin traded 809% higher at $0.699 at press time.

701,"Facebook Inc FB disabled a 157,000-member trading discussion group on its platform that discussed shares of companies like GameStop Corporation GME and others, Reuters reported Thursday. What Happened: The group — Robinhood Stock Traders — was created by Allen Tran, a 23-year old who was notified by the social network giant that it had been taken down for violating policies on “adult sexual exploitation,” according to Reuters. “We were first on the picking tree to be cut off because we are on Facebook, not a free platform like Reddit,”  said Tran. Some members of the Facebook group reportedly made tens of thousands of dollars in trades made popular by the Reddit discussion group r/WallStreetBets, as per Reuters. Facebook confirmed the removal of the group to Reuters and refused to comment further. Why It Matters: The group’s creator alleged that “major institutions being frustrated with the success of retail,” and that they are trying to target  “any groups they can,” reported Reuters. The Reddit group — at the center of the short squeeze frenzy in the stocks of GameStop, Blackberry Ltd BB, Nokia Oyj NOK, and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc AMC, went private and then public again in close succession on Wednesday.  The digital distribution platform Discord also discontinued service to WallStreetBets on the same day. Tesla Inc TSLA CEO Elon Musk decried Discord’s move and said it had gone “Corpo.” Price Action: Facebook shares closed almost 2.6% lower at $265 on Thursday and fell 0.11% in the after-hours trading. © 2024 Benzinga.com.

703,"Alphabet Inc GOOGL GOOG subsidiary Google is removing thousands of negative reviews left on the Robinhood trading app at its Play Store, the Verge reported Thursday. What Happened: The Robinhood app was blasted with nearly 100,000 negative reviews on Thursday. The total number of reviewers stood at over 274,000 at the time. The app’s rating fell down to one star due to the review bombing, while the app previously enjoyed a four-star rating, 9to5Google reported. The rating has since gone back up to four stars after enough reviews were deleted by Google. As of press time, the App was rated by 177,501 reviewers. Robinhood on Thursday prevented its users from entering new positions in the shares of GameStop Corp GME, AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc AMC, and others. Why It Matters: Participants in the Reddit forum that have fed the short squeeze frenzy of late in the shares of GameStop Corp, AMC, Blackberry Ltd BB, Nokia Oyj NOK, and others called for tanking the app’s ratings at Apple Inc’s AAPL  App Store and Google Play, according to a post on r/WallStreetBets.

714,"Many new video games come out during the holiday season, making them popular gifts. Not many parents, however, could have imagined that stock might have been a better present. What Happened: The video game sector saw record sales of $7.7 billion in December, up 25% year-over-year according to Venture Beat. Sales of video game content including physical and digital sales hit $5.8 billion, up 23% year-over-year. The top-selling video games were “Call of Duty: Black Ops: Cold War” from Activision Blizzard, Inc. ATVI, “Cyberpunk 2077” and “Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla” New games cost around $60 at a retailer like GameStop Corp GME. Related Link: How Retail Option Traders Are Supercharging The Short Squeeze In GameStop Stock Instead Of Game: Many parents likely gifted video games to their kids during the holidays. While many kids would be happy with a video game to play on their new console from Sony Corporation SNE or Microsoft Corporation MSFT, they might have better served with stock instead. The rise of GameStop has been one of the hottest investing stories as the company is now one of the 500 most valuable companies in the world with new investors have flocked to the heavily shorted stock. Instead of buying a new $60 video game on Christmas Eve, a parent could have bought three shares of GameStop with shares around $20. Those three shares would now be worth $1,060.29. A gift of GameStop stock instead of a new video game could have led to profits that could pay for a new video game console like the Playstation 5 or Xbox Series X and multiple video games.

724,"Elon Musk is aiming to drill gas wells in South Texas to make its own fuel and electricity to power its Starship spacecraft, Bloomberg has reported.  What Happened: According to Bloomberg, Musk's space company SpaceX is looking to drill wells close to the company's Boca Chica, Texas, launchpad that previously hosted prototype launches for the company. The Texas SpaceX site will be supplied by at least five nearby gas wells, along with two gas-fired power plants. However, these plans are on hold due to a legal dispute between the SpaceX subsidiary Lone Star Mineral Development and Dallas Petroleum Group, which claims ownership of some inactive wells sitting on the same land. Why It Matters: Tesla Inc TSLA CEO Musk has long advocated renewable energy and electric vehicles as the keys to staving off a climate crisis. Musk said he ultimately aims to extract carbon from the atmosphere to produce fuel, but no such technology exists yet. But producing his own natural gas also fits with another Musk theme, that of vertical integration and control. Doing it this way would allow him to bypass third parties, Bloomberg noted.

741,"The cryptocurrency XRP is skyrocketing, up 61.8% since Saturday at $0.4769. What Happened: The surge in the digital asset backing the decentralized payments platform Ripple comes even as other major cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) retreat.

The surge in XRP comes as part of a similar coordinated effort to pump as was seen in Dogecoin last week.

The company received a boost from a Wall Street Journal report last month that said President Joe Biden intended to nominate former Treasury Department official Michael Barr to head the office of the comptroller of the currency.

See also: How to Buy Ripple (XRP) The joke cryptocurrency traded 33% higher at $0.03847 at press time, down about 50% from the all-time high of  $0.0791 hit on Friday. Why Is XRP Surging? The surge in XRP comes as part of a similar coordinated effort to pump as was seen in Dogecoin last week. Besides the motley calls to buy XRP on the r/SatoshiStreetBets community, a Telegram group called “Buy & Hold XRP” also cropped up on Saturday, as reported by CoinDesk. See also: Ripple vs. Ethereum Kenetic Capital co-founder Jehan Chu told the cryptocurrency publication that “traditional Crypto-Pump groups are being copied and legitimized by WallStreetBets-style crowd-pumps, and are now turning their burning gaze from dogecoin to XRP.” XRP and the company behind it — Ripple Labs Inc. — have been troubled by a Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit over whether the cryptocurrency constitutes a security. The company received a boost from a Wall Street Journal report last month that said President Joe Biden intended to nominate former Treasury Department official Michael Barr to head the office of the comptroller of the currency. Barr had joined Ripple as an advisor back in 2015. Ripple also announced last month that Amazon.com Inc. AMZN Vice President of Delivery Experience Devraj Varadhan had joined its team as the senior vice president of engineering. © 2024 Benzinga.com. Benzinga does not provide investment advice.

743,"The interest in Dogecoin is skyrocketing — in fact, it briefly overtook Bitcoin (BTC) in terms of sparking Twitter interest, becoming the first cryptocurrency to do so, as per The TIE. The cryptocurrency surged to an all-time high of $0.0791 on Friday from trading at $0.0077 a day ago, thanks to calls for pumping from r/SatoshiStreetBets and a signature subtle tweet from Tesla Inc. TSLA CEO Elon Musk. What Makes Doge A Prime Candidate? Dogecoin is a veteran meme cryptocurrency invented in 2013 by International Business Machines Corporation IBM engineer Billy Markus and Adobe Inc. ADBE engineer Jackson Palmer. The founders have since moved on and are in fact disenchanted with the project. Markus said on Twitter Saturday that he was being ""harassed"" by Dogecoin investors again with the latest surge despite having left the project seven years ago over similar concerns. A joke cryptocurrency featuring the famed Shiba Inu that trades at a low price point and is primarily driven by the community, rather than a company or a team, is likely why Dogecoin is seeing more interest from the Redditors over other digital assets. Where Does Dogecoin Come From? Dogecoin is an indirect fork of Bitcoin. The cryptocurrency was created as a fork of now-obsolete Luckycoin, which was itself a fork of Litecoin, which was forked out of Bitcoin. Explaining the decision to fork out of Luckycoin, Palmer explained in 2019 that the founders wanted to make the project as “undesirable” as possible. Luckycoin had random block rewards built into its blockchain and that would disincentivize miners from creating more of the cryptocurrency, Palmer said at the time. See Also: How to Buy Dogecoin (DOGE) What About Its Supply? When Dogecoin initially launched, Palmer said the supply would be infinite – no surprise since the founders wanted it to be “undesirable.” In 2014, however, the co-founder said the cryptocurrency would be capped at 100 billion supply and 5 billion new coins could be created each year. As of press time, there are about 128.18 billion dogecoins in circulation supply, as per CoinMarketCap data. Just one cryptocurrency, BitTorrent (BTT), has a higher circulation supply at about 990 billion. For context, Bitcoin has a circulating supply of 18.6 million coins, and only 21 million coins of the world’s apex cryptocurrency can ever be minted, as per the rules embedded in its blockchain. The constrained supply is supposed to help with keeping the price of Bitcoin up with an anticipated rise in demand. Palmer and Markus were not concerned with keeping the price of Dogecoin up and didn’t pay heed to supply constraints. How Has Dogecoin Traded Historically? Dogecoin began trading in late 2013 at around $0.0003. The joke would soon pick up and Dogecoin price tripled by February 2014, tripling at $0.0015, and outperforming Bitcoin. Dogecoin has seen momentary surges since, mostly as part of coordinated efforts to pump. It traded above $0.013 in early 2018 when altcoins were surging with a pause in the Bitcoin rally after it crossed the $20,000 mark.  Image: Dogecoin All-Time Performance Relative To Bitcoin, Courtesy Of CoinMarketCap The cryptocurrency has traded mostly muted since 2019, with Musk or adult film stars or TikTokers or ""Tiger King"" cast driving occasional surges. The latest surge is unprecedented in Dogecoin history, but with other cryptocurrencies already hounding the pumping interest on social media, the parody cryptocurrency has retreated significantly back to $0.0375 at press time late Sunday from the all-time high hit on Friday. © 2024 Benzinga.com.

748,"Tesla Inc TSLA CEO Elon Musk appeared on Clubhouse on early Monday morning and talked about a wide variety of subjects ranging from colonization of Mars to the latest on his companies. On The Future of Tesla: The entrepreneur said that the automaker wants to make 20 million cars and trucks per year.  Musk touched on increasing the utility of vehicles equipped with full-self-driving technology — a familiar theme as he had talked about this at the company’s latest earnings. The CEO explained that cars equipped with FSD could be useful for 60 hours a week, while conventional cars are useful for only about 12-hours a week. See Also: Elon Musk Says Tesla Valuation Justified If Utility Of Robotaxis Is Factored “We are trying to grow car production as fast as possible. The primary limiting factor is battery cell production,” said Musk.  The auto executive said Tesla was not trying to put the company’s battery partners out of business and said they were “great suppliers.” The executive named Panasonic, LG Chem, and others and stressed the need to increase production.  Musk also said he had no antagonism towards LiDAR technology but thinks that when it comes to “driving on real-world” roads, you have to solve vision. See also: How to Invest in Tesla Stock On Space Exploration: The CEO admitted that going to Mars would be “hard” for the early explorers and would be akin to keeping the “candle of civilization alive in the dark.” The CEO said there is no conclusive evidence to support the existence of aliens but did not deny the possibility of the existence of alien technology.  Bitcoin and Dogecoin: Musk said that Bitcoin is on the verge of getting broad acceptance by “conventional finance people.” The executive said he jokes about Dogecoin and his jokes should be taken as such.  “The most entertaining and ironic outcome would be if Dogecoin becomes the currency of Earth in the future,” said Musk, claiming he was a fan of ironic outcomes.  See Also: Elon Musk Says 'I'm A Supporter Of Bitcoin' On Vaccines and COVID-19: Musk touched upon the advances made in medicine, especially mRNA technology. He noted that vaccines for COVID-19 were developed using such tech. A company that he mentioned specifically in relation to this was Moderna Inc MRNA. He also noted that Moderna and Pfizer Inc PFE vaccines needed ultracold temperatures as they were MRNA-based.  Musk said there’s an “avalanche of vaccine” coming and the resultant glut would mean that some of it would have to be “thrown away this year.” Neuralink: On Neuralink, Musk said that it was about staying “relevant.” The entrepreneur said people are already cyborgs and a direct neural interface would increase the bit-rate of communication between people and devices such as phones. Musk revealed that the earliest applications of Neuralink would be for people who are suffering from brain injuries. Photo courtesy: Daniel Oberhaus via Flickr © 2024 Benzinga.com.

752,"Dogecoin DOGE/USD is one of the hottest cryptocurrencies in the world. The question for many investors could be whether they are pronouncing the name correctly. How to Pronounce Dogecoin: Despite having dog in its name and a Shiba Inu dog as the official mascot, the correct pronunciation of the Dogecoin cryptocurrency is “dohj coin” according to Dictionary.com and its co-founder Jackson Palmer. Other pronunciations listed for Dogecoin are “dohg koin” and “dog-ee koin.” Related Link: Carol Baskin Pumps Dogecoin  About Dogecoin: Palmer created Dogecoin after a popular meme featuring a dog with a sidelong glance.

757,"Each day, Benzinga takes a look back at a notable market-related moment that occurred on this date. What Happened? On this day in 2016, Alphabet Inc GOOG GOOGL briefly became the world’s largest public company. Where Was The Market? The S&P 500 was trading at 1,939.38 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was at 16,449.18. What Else Was Going On In The World? In 2016, 195 countries joined together to sign the Paris Agreement on climate change, and the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union via the Brexit referendum vote. In the U.S., in-state college tuition cost averaged $24,610. A Short Reign: In February 2016, Google’s parent company Alphabet briefly passed Apple, Inc. AAPL as the world’s largest company by market cap. Alphabet’s stock jumped after the company reported better-than-expected earnings, but Apple regained its title only two days later. Apple expanded its lead over Google in 2017, gaining 42.6% on the year and finishing with a market cap of $868.8 billion compared to Alphabet’s $731.9 billion.  © 2024 Benzinga.com.

759,"Another busy week for traders and investors with earnings, economic data, central bank activity, and lot to keep an eye on. First, it was a busy week last week with something like 120 S&P 500 companies reporting quarterly, and U.S. indices to new all-time highs reflected the better-than-expected earnings results in most cases. The Fed announcement and comments from Jerome Powell created very few waves, but he assured investors rates will remain low for a prolonged period. The U.S. Dollar firmed some last week on better-than-expected economic data. This week, keep an eye out for quarterly results from Pfizer Inc. PFE, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, Alphabet Inc GOOGL, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. CMG, Spotify Technology SPOT, and eBay EBAY, to name a few of the more closely-watched companies reporting results that could move markets. As far as economic data that could move markets, this week we have a fair amount of PMI data, the ISM Service Index on Wednesday, and jobs reports. The primary focus will be the Unemployment Report on Friday. Don't forget about the central bank activity overseas: we have the Bank of England (BOE) and the Bank of Australia (RBA). Keep an eye on Gold; Silver spiked last week and continued its advances in the overnight session to levels we haven’t seen since 2013, and Gold took notice. I found it interesting the two big moves lower in the indices last week sparked very little, if any, buying in Gold, and while the VIX spiked, Gold was flat mostly around 1850. Watch the U.S. Dollar inching higher; while this would normally be a headwind for Gold, with Silver rallying like this, that Gold/Dollar inverse correlation could break down for a while.

765,"Another busy week of earnings will be in its full splendor on Tuesday with Pfizer Inc. PFE, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd BABA, tech titans Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN and Alphabet Inc GOOGGOOGL along with the oil giant Exxon Mobil Corporation XOM. Besides Pfizer, we're also in for other healthcare earnings update from Sanofi SA SNY, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc REGN, Merck & Co., Inc. MRK and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co BMY. We will also get a glimpse at the social media world with Snap Inc SNAP and Pinterest Inc PINS fourth-quarter reporting after the closing bell on Thursday, along with digital payments universe updates from PayPal Holdings Inc PYPL that saw a record in crypto transaction in January. There will also be some gaming with Activision Blizzard, Inc. ATVI, automotive news from the legendary Ford Motor Company F, and even beauty updates from Estée Lauder Companies Inc EL to wrap up the week. As for Exxon's fourth-quarter financial results, Wall Street will be looking at how the oil giant aims to make further cuts to capital expenditure, along with handling changes to its board and more investment in sustainable technologies. Alibaba is expected to deliver earnings of $3.22 per share on revenue of $32.98 billion, after the stock has rebounded strongly after the shares were punished due to its founder disappearing from public for weeks. Its stock also plunged in late December after an IPO for Ma's Ant Group was suspended. But with the Chinese economy on a path towards revitalization, growth expectations are high given that the company controls some two-thirds of China's e-commerce market through Taobao and Tmall. On Tuesday, the company must show to it can remain on a sustained path to recovery. Speaking of e-commerce, Amazon is expected to have earned $7.19 per share on revenue of $119.66 billion. Although its shares have seemingly gone nowhere over the past six months, Amazon has executed at near perfection evidenced by an almost 40% rise in total net revenue in the third quarter which included operating margin of 6.4% of sales. The e-commerce giant continues to benefit from strong demand acceleration caused by the pandemic, growing its Prime members, but also getting them to spend more during each transaction. There is also plenty of evidence to suggests that its market share gains are here to stay beyond the pandemic. Although Amazon and Shopify Inc SHOP posted wider gains than eBay Inc EBAY, its investors had a great 2020 with the stock price comfortably outpacing the broader market and even Walmart Inc WMT. Don't give up on eBay just yet as we're about to find out on Thursday just how well it did during the holidays and overall year and if it can convince its small businesses to stick around and maintain the positive momentum. Google's parent is expected to deliver earnings of $15.98 per share on revenue of $53.11 billion. Alphabet's shares outperformed its FAANG peers over the past week, rising 4% year to date, given the cyclical recovery in its online advertising business, particularly in areas such as retail, financial services, travel, and optimism that has been supported by Facebook, Inc.'s FB recent results. Peloton Interactive Inc PTON will report after the close on Thursday, with Wall Street expecting 8 cents per share on revenue of $1.03 billion as it finds it to be well-positioned to disrupt the fitness industry through its at-home connected fitness subscription platform which is still seeing accelerated demand. With COVID-19 induced gym cancellations, investors will only want to know if the good news are already priced in. Moving from fitness to intellectual property, the multinational QUALCOMM, Inc. QCOM is expected to report a profit of $2.10 in the fiscal first quarter from its services that relate to wireless technology. This would represent a YoY growth of over 110% from the same quarter last year. The company is expected to benefit from improvement in smartphone demand in 2021, 5G adding greater dollar content and the potential elimination of a major competitor in the Chinese market, HiSilicon, as Huawei currently does not pay royalties. Make no mistake, this earnings week will be a busy one. This article is not a press release and is contributed by a verified independent journalist for IAMNewswire.

767,"Tesla Inc TSLA got a massive price target boost from Piper Sandler, with the firm dissuading investors from selling the stock. The Tesla Analyst:  Alexander Potter has an Overweight rating on Tesla shares and he upped the price target from $515 to a Street-high $1,200. The Tesla Thesis:  Tesla is now a component of the S&P 500 Index and many of issues that plagued the company have been now addressed, Potter said in a note.vThe stock cannot be overlooked now and any downside catalyst materializing will be met with eager buying, the analyst said.

786,"Bitcoin is struggling to find momentum even as Tesla Inc TSLA CEO Elon Musk expressed explicit support for the world's apex cryptocurrency on Monday. What Happened: Bitcoin traded mostly unchanged over 24 hours at $33,670 at press time late Monday, retreating from the above $38,000 levels it was trading at last week after Musk initially updated his Twitter bio to “#Bitcoin.”  The cryptocurrency’s gains are outshined by a decentralized finance, or DeFi, cryptocurrency. See also: How to Buy Bitcoin (BTC) SushiSwap (SUSHI) traded about 32% higher at $13.43 at press time. The cryptocurrency has surged about 61.4% against the U.S. dollar over the past seven days and 281% over 30 days, as per data from Messari. It outshines Bitcoin, up 1025.9% against the apex cryptocurrency over a period of 90 days. Among other Defi coins, Uniswap (UNI) has surged 13.2% to $19.74 over 24 hours. Aave (AAVE), another DeFi coin that has added 211.7% gains over 30 days, is down 2.5% to $290.49 at press time. Ethereum (ETH) cryptocurrency, which supports the primary blockchain platform associated with DeFi projects, is up 5% at $1,387.30. Why It Matters: DeFi cryptocurrencies have been seeing momentum over the past month as total value locked (TLV) in such projects increases. According to DeFi pulse, the TLV for overall DeFi projects has increased to $27.68 billion as of press time. SushiSwap, the DeFi project supported by the SUSHI cryptocurrency, has a TLV of $2.34 billion. SushiSwap's share of the decentralized-exchange market is also increasing rapidly, as per Dune Analytics data. The SushiSwap trading volume made up for 23.3% of the DEX market at press time.

795,"The Reddit retail investor crowd that pushed up stocks of GameStop Corp GME, AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc AMC, and others could next set their sights on the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap — Bitcoin (BTC). Bit Of A Laggard: The apex cryptocurrency has remained largely muted and has failed to hitch a ride on the retail rocket that has lifted other cryptocurrencies such as XRP (XRP) and Dogecoin (DOGE) lately. The so-called digital gold has been lackluster even in comparison with silver, which peaked to new highs over Monday. The lack of movement in Bitcoin is despite the fact that Tesla Inc TSLA CEO Elon Musk expressed support for the coin on Monday. Previously, Musk’s utterances had sent DOGE and BTC soaring — the former skyrocketing an impressive 800%. Bets On Bitcoin: Musk’s previous utterances have not gone unnoticed on r/WallStreetBets. Short Change: There are parallels between the GameStop saga and Bitcoin, according to CNBC. Data from The Block Crypto indicates that hedge funds are short on the apex coin by over $1 billion.  The shorting picked up speed around October last year which coincides with the uptick in Bitcoin price. The cryptocurrency reached its all-time high of $41,941.56 on Jan. 8.  At the same time, retail interest in cryptocurrencies has remained strong, with Robinhood having to shut off some cryptocurrency trading features as DOGE soared. The brokerage also restricted buying of GameStop and other shares amid the retail frenzy.  The Long and Short Of It: WallStreetBets has spurred conversation among Bitcoin enthusiasts of a similar short squeeze rally in the cryptocurrency. If you don’t own #bitcoin right now, your position is long USD shitcoin and short bitcoin. Think about that for a moment. Bitcoin Archive, which claims to track the cryptocurrency as it proves every prediction of “doom” wrong, tweeted that while GameStop squeezed hedge funds, Bitcoin is squeezing central banks. The short squeeze on GameStop is exactly what’s coming to #Bitcoin.
Almost $500m of #BTC was moved off Coinbase last night. These big movements tend to happen just before massive price movements.  pic.twitter.com/jKxxr527ua Price Action: Bitcoin traded 0.81% higher at $33,914.18 at press time. Grayscale Bitcoin Trust GBTC closed 2.13% lower at $33.95 on Monday. Benzinga’s Take: The recent volatility in the price of BTC and other cryptocurrencies like DOGE and XRP should act as a caution to investors. The rallies in both the cryptocurrencies were short-lived. The ride on the pump and dump rollercoaster is perilous and investors should be wary of timing the market. © 2024 Benzinga.com.

806,"Tesla Inc TSLA shares traded higher on Tuesday morning as investors shrugged off a 135,000-vehicle safety recall and one Wall Street analyst hiked his price target for the stock. The Tesla Analyst: Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas reiterated his Overweight rating for Tesla and raised his price target from $810 to $880. See also: How to Invest in Tesla Stock The Tesla Thesis: Jonas said the new price target reflects Tesla’s fourth-quarter earnings report, which indicated weaker margins, a healthier balance sheet and more aggressive growth objectives. “Elon Musk emphasized the importance of growth in its core EV market and conveyed the role of rapid capacity expansion, coupled with vertical integration down to the battery cell in protecting the company’s leadership position in the market,” Jonas wrote in a note. Musk is targeting 50% compound annual revenue growth in the next several years, well ahead of Morgan Stanley’s projection of 27% auto unit CAGR through 2030. Morgan Stanley is projecting 785,000 Tesla deliveries in 2021, up roughly 57% compared to 2020. Tesla fell just short of its goal of 500,000 deliveries last year. Related Link: Tesla And 9 Other Stocks That Burned Short Sellers The Most In 2020  Morgan Stanley’s price target hike comes the same day Tesla announced it is recalling up to 134,951 vehicles due to safety risks associated with malfunctioning touchscreen displays. The recall comes more than two weeks after the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration urged Tesla to issue the recall due to safety concerns. Tesla shares are up 1,780% in the past year and a half, and are now trading at 96.2 times Morgan Stanley’s 2023 EPS estimate. However, even at its current price, Jonas said the stock should still be a “core EV portfolio holding.” Benzinga’s Take: In a 2021 market that cares only about stories, Tesla has the best story of them all. The stock’s bullish momentum will likely continue in the near-term, but the company has some extremely high expectations to live up to over the next 10 or 15 years to justify its $800 billion market cap. © 2024 Benzinga.com.

823," Related Stories Although Jeff Bezos announced on Tuesday that he will step down as Amazon CEO and transition to executive chair of the company's board, he has no plans of retiring. ""Being the CEO of Amazon is a deep responsibility, and it's consuming,"" Bezos wrote in a letter to employees announcing his role change. ""When you have a responsibility like that, it's hard to put attention on anything else."" As executive chair, Bezos said he plans to ""stay engaged in Amazon initiatives,"" but also put energy into his ""other passions,"" like ""the Day 1 Fund, the Bezos Earth Fund, Blue Origin, The Washington Post,"" to name a few. ""As much as I still tap dance into the office, I'm excited about this transition,"" he said. Today, Amazon is an e-commerce behemoth with a market value of about $1.7 trillion. But when Jeff Bezos started the online bookseller in 1994, he thought it was likely that his business would fail. At the time, ""most people didn't pay attention to us or care about us,"" Bezos said at a 2018 Partnership for Public Service gala. And, before Amazon's launch, most people did not even know what the internet was, he said. ""The question I was asked most frequently at that time was, 'What's the internet?'"" Bezos wrote in his letter to employees. When Bezos was deciding whether to take a huge risk, quit his stable job at a hedge fund and start Amazon out of his garage, his then-employer and family members worried about his future – but, ""I pictured myself 80 years old, thinking back on my life in a quiet moment of reflection,"" he during a fireside chat in India in 2020. ""I wanted not to have regrets. I knew for a fact, I have this idea, and if I don't try, I'm going to regret having never tried."" Of course, his decision paid off – and nowadays, Bezos said, the reaction from people is different. ""Blessedly, I haven't had to explain [the internet] in a long while,"" he said in his letter.  ""If you get it right, a few years after a surprising invention, the new thing has become normal,"" he said. ""People yawn. And that yawn is the greatest compliment an inventor can receive.""

844,"UKRAINE - 2021/01/29: In this photo illustration an Apple logo seen displayed on a mobile phone and ... [+] a pc screen. (Photo Illustration by Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) had a solid Q1 FY’21, posting record Revenues that topped $110 billion led by the new 5G iPhones. Apple’s Operating Margins also soared by a remarkable 220 basis points year over year to about 30.1%. Can Apple sustain these margins going forward? Let’s take a closer look at what drove Apple’s Products and Services Gross Margins and Operating Expenses to find out. Apple’s Product Gross Margins, or the profits it makes after accounting for direct costs related to making its iDevices, computers, and accessories, rose by around 90 basis points year over year to 35.1%. Although we actually expected margins to face pressure on account of higher costs relating to 5G components on the new iPhones, Apple significantly beat our margin expectations, driven by a couple of factors. Firstly, Apple has a certain level of fixed costs in its product cost structures and with the product Revenue soaring by about 21%, it benefited from some leverage gains. Secondly, Apple’s product mix has been more favorable than previous quarters, with Apple nudging customers towards “Pro” versions of its devices, which likely have thicker margins. In fact, Apple raised the price of its iPhone 12 versus last year’s iPhone 11, making its iPhone 12 Pro models (priced at $1,000 and up) look like better value compared to last year. Apple’s Services business also saw Gross Margins soar to around 68.4%, an increase of around 400 basis points versus last year. Services Revenue grew by a strong 24% year-over-year, likely enabling better-fixed cost absorption. Apple also likely saw a large percentage of commission-driven revenues such as App sales and subscriptions, which are much more profitable. Apple’s operating expenses rose by just about 12% year-over-year compared to total Revenues which expanded by 21% and this was also a factor that drove its Operating Margin gains, in addition to the Gross Profit gains. Our dashboard Breaking Down Apple’s Services Revenue estimates the revenue figures for AppStore, Apple Music, Apple TV+, iCloud, Third-party Subscriptions, Licensing, Apple Care, and Apple Pay. So can Apple sustain margins at these levels? We think so. Apple’s 2021 Revenues are projected to jump by a solid 21%, per consensus estimates, likely growing faster than Apple’s cost base. Moreover, the full impact of the new iPhone 12 is only likely to be seen in the coming quarters, as production picks up and the devices see full quarters of availability. For perspective, the device went on sale only about 3 to 4 weeks into Q1’FY21, with popular models remaining short supplied. [1/25/2021] Will The iPhone 12 Deliver For Apple? Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is slated to publish its Q1 FY’21 earnings on January 27, reporting on a quarter that saw the launch of its much anticipated 5G iPhone 12. We expect Revenues to come in at about $100 billion for the quarter, growing by about 9% versus last year, with EPS likely to grow by about 7% to around $1.35 per share. Our estimates are marginally below the consensus. So what are the key trends that are likely to drive earnings? Firstly, Revenues should see a bump driven by strong demand for the 5G iPhones, which saw multiple models remain back-ordered through the holidays. Apple should also see higher average selling prices for the iconic smartphone, as it raised base pricing on the iPhone 12 versus the iPhone 11, while nudging customers toward the more premium iPhone Pro models (priced at $1,000 and up), which appear to be a better value compared to last year. Apple’s Services business is also likely to have had its strongest quarter yet, driven by the App Store. In fact, Apple provided a data point indicating that between Christmas Eve and New Year’s Eve, a total of $1.8 billion was spent on apps, up 27% versus last year. [1] App sales growth over the same period last year was about 16%. That said, Apple’s margins could see some pressure, as the new iPhones are likely to be more expensive to produce compared to last year as 5G components are pricier. Apple stock has rallied by about 65% over the last 12 months, driven largely by anticipation surrounding the 5G iPhones. Apple stock now trades at 33x projected EPS, making it look pricey compared to historical levels. The Q1 FY’21 earnings should give investors a good sense of how the device is faring and could be key to Apple’s stock trajectory in the near-term. See our pre-earnings analysis Apple Earnings Preview: Will Apple Beat Expectations? for more details on Apple’s recent performance and what’s driving its valuation. [12/9/2020] Apple’s Services Will Overtake The iPhone By 2024 Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) Services business is likely to emerge as its most profitable (and valuable) business within the next four years, likely eclipsing even the iPhone – which is seen as one of the most lucrative consumer products of all time. Here’s how we expect this to play out. We expect Services sales to grow at a rate of about 11% a year (down from a rate of 22% each year over the last 4 years) to $81.5 billion in FY’24, driven by the continued growth of the AppStore and subscription services. On the other hand, we expect iPhone Revenues to grow at an average rate of about 5% each year over the next four years to about $167 billion (iPhone Revenue remained almost flat between 2016 and 2020). Now Apple’s services have much thicker margins compared to hardware products. Over FY’20, Apple’s product Gross Margins stood at 31.5% versus about 66% for Services. If we assume that margins remain flat at current levels, Services Gross Profits would stand at about $54 billion in FY’24, compared to about $53 billion for the iPhone. In fact, Operating Profits could actually be much higher for Services, considering that much of Apple’s Services sales come via commissions, with little marketing or development expenses involved. Our dashboard Breaking Down Apple’s Services Revenue estimates the revenue figures for AppStore, Apple Music, Apple TV+, iCloud, Third-party Subscriptions, Licensing, Apple Care, and Apple Pay. However, there are a few caveats. Firstly, Apple’s Service business is quite dependent on fees Google
GOOG
 pays Apple for being the default search engine on its iDevices (an estimated 20% of Services Revenue, and a larger percentage of profits). There’s a possibility that the U.S. Justice Department’s antitrust lawsuit against Google could jeopardize these payments, hurting Apple’s services growth. Secondly, Apple is increasingly investing in content production with services such as AppleTV+ and these offerings could also have lower margins. So what does this mean for Apple stock? Internet services led companies have typically commanded higher valuation multiples compared to hardware plays on account of their thicker margins, and associated platform related lock-ins. However, in Apple’s case, this is likely already baked into its valuation. Apple’s trailing P/E multiple has soared and almost doubled over the past year to levels of around 38x currently – which is in line with other Internet players such as Alphabet. [Updated 11/23/2020] What’s The Impact Of The AppStore Commission Cut? Last week, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) indicated that it would be cutting its commissions on app sales and in-app purchases from 30% to 15% for smaller developers, who earn less than $1 million annually from the AppStore. Apple has been facing significant criticism that its AppStore practices hurt smaller developers and tech giants, including Apple, face increasing scrutiny from regulators regarding their market power. This move should help Apple’s image to a large extent. App analytics company Sensor Tower estimates that about 98% of the developers that pay Apple commissions will benefit. [2] However, will reducing commissions by half impact the performance of Apple’s highly lucrative and fast-growing Services business? After all, the AppStore is estimated to account for roughly a third of Apple’s Services Revenue. Not really. Apple earns a bulk of its AppStore revenue from the largest developers, with Sensor Tower indicating that developers who benefit from this program accounted for under 5% of App Store revenues last year. Moreover, the discounted fee will only apply until developers cross the $1 million threshold, after which Apple will bill them at the higher 30% commission rate. [Updated 8/17/2020] How The Epic Lawsuit Impacts Apple Last week, Epic Games sued Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) for antitrust violations, after its popular Fortnite game was removed from the AppStore shortly after Epic let players bypass Apple’s in-app purchase system, avoiding the 30% commission on sales. Although Apple has had spats with developers in the past, the Epic lawsuit is noteworthy for a couple of reasons. Firstly, the Epic lawsuit comes at a time when tech giants, including Apple, have been facing increasing scrutiny from regulators regarding their market power. Secondly, Apple is more dependent on its Services business than ever before, with hardware growth slowing (profits from Services grew 5x as fast as hardware profits over the first three-quarters of FY’20), and Epic’s lawsuit targets Apple’s commissions, which we estimate are Apple’s single most profitable revenue stream. Apple made roughly about $360 million in commissions from Fortnite over the last two years per Sensor Tower – a relative drop in the bucket for Apple which pulled in $260 billion-plus in revenues last year. [1] However, if Epic sees a favorable judgment, and if Apple is forced to reduce its commissions or change the terms of its AppStore, this is very likely to set a precedent, causing other developers to demand similar terms. So what could be the financial impact of Apple reducing commissions across the board? Apple takes a 30% cut on App sales and subscriptions (15% from the second year of subscriptions) and we estimate that total commission revenues stood at almost $20 billion in FY’19 (out of a total of about $46 billion in Services Revenue). If Apple reduced commissions to say 20% from 30%, it would reduced total commissions by about $7 billion to roughly $13 billion. Although the revenue impact would be limited for Apple (under 3% of Apple’s Total Revenue) the impact on profits would be more pronounced given that commissions are likely to be almost entirely profit. We estimate that Apple’s Operating Income would be about 10% lower if commissions were reduced, considering Apple posted about $64 billion in Operating Income in FY’19. Now commissions of 30% are actually pretty standard across the industry – Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google, which also faces a similar lawsuit from Epic, as well as Microsoft
MSFT
 and Amazon
AMZN
, charge roughly the same fees on app sales on their respective market places. However, Apple has the most to lose from this given the sheer scale of its business. AppStore revenues are roughly twice as large as Google’s Playstore. See all Trefis Price Estimates and Download Trefis Data here What’s behind Trefis?

FAQ - New Privacy Policy Amazon Inc. investors were on Tuesday evening surprised with news that CEO Jeff Bezos would later this year step aside to become executive chairman. Shares of the Seattle-based e-commerce giant were little changed Wednesday despite the news of the billionaire's exit as investors wagered the Amazon founder could still have an influence on operations. Amazon stock was holding just below record highs. AMAZON'S BEZOS EXPLAINS WHY HE IS STEPPING ASIDE  “It is not clear to us that Mr. Bezos will actually withdraw from day-to-day oversight of the business,” wrote Michael Pachter, analyst at Wedbush Securities. “We expect him to continue to be integrally involved in company strategy.” AMAZON CEO JEFF BEZOS MAY STEP DOWN WITHOUT STEPPING AWAY Bezos, who has been chief executive since he founded the company in 1994, grew Amazon into a $1.7 trillion e-commerce behemoth. The company was a $570 million online book retailer following its 1997 initial public offering. This year, shares were up 3.78% year to date through Tuesday compared with the S&P 500’s 1.87% gain and have gained 65% during the past 52 weeks. Bezos will give way to Andy Jassy, the current head of the Amazon Web Services, one of the company's fastest-growing arms. WHO IS ANDY JASSY, AMAZON'S INCOMING CEO Jassy, who co-founded Amazon Web Services in 2003 and has been at Amazon since 1997, is a “natural fit” to succeed Bezos, wrote Truist analyst Youssef Squali. Amazon Web Services accounts for about 70% of Amazon’s revenue. “The transition to Andy Jassy’s leadership to be seamless and largely inconsequential,” Pachter wrote.

See also: How to Invest in Tesla Stock Tesla China received approval on January 29, 2021, on an environmental impact report from the Lingang Area Development and Construction Management Committee, according to Tesmanian. This would allow Tesla to start construction of a factory where the new model would begin production. The report says Tesla didn't need to acquire new land and will build the facility on land the company already owns. The project will perform tests related to the launch of a new vehicle. The testing cycle is about six months for verification, coordination of parts and function. Last month, rumors sprung up that Tesla would be releasing its $25,000 vehicle in China in 2022. This new report shows Tesla is on track to meet that rumored deadline. Tesla is already a popular brand in China, and introducing a more affordable model would only increase demand.

869,"The shares of Sundial Growers Inc (NASDAQ:SNDL) spiked 16.3% in the regular session on Wednesday. What Happened: The surge came amid the overall strength in the cannabis industry following the announcement of a merger & acquisition deal between GW Pharmaceuticals PLC (NASDAQ:GWPH) and Jazz Pharmaceuticals PLC (NASDAQ:JAZZ).

871,"Dave Portnoy said he purchased $700,000 worth of AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc AMC shares Wednesday. What Happened: The Barstool Sports owner told Fox Business host Stuart Varney that he bought back into the theater chain after exiting positions in the Reddit hot stocks earlier on Tuesday. “I put in $700,000 into AMC this morning,” Portnoy told Varney, adding that he was “up” $60,000 on his investment.

883,"Despite an ongoing pandemic and a struggling underlying U.S. economy, the Nasdaq is now trading more than 90% above its March 2020 lows. Any tech investor during the past five years knows just how much of the recent growth in the tech sector is attributed to the five growth superstars of the Nasdaq: Facebook, Inc. FB, Apple Inc. AAPL, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, Netflix Inc NFLX and Alphabet Inc. GOOGGOOGL. These so-called FAANG stocks continue to deliver year-after-year of incredible growth numbers, even as their market caps swell to some of the largest in market history.

Concerns over slowing economic growth in China sent the index tumbling to as low as 4,209.76 in early 2016, its low point of the past five years. From that point, growth numbers from the FAANG group and the rest of the tech sector sent the Nasdaq on a tear. The index broke the 6,000 mark in 2017 and 8,000 mark in 2018. At that point, the Nasdaq ran out of steam. A trade war with China, Federal Reserve interest rate hikes and ramping regulatory scrutiny of the FAANG stocks sent the Nasdaq tumbling back down to as low as 6,190 by the end of the year.

885,"GOTHENBURG, SWEDEN - 2019/09/14: An American automotive and energy company that specialises in ... [+] electric car manufacturing Tesla logo seen in Gothenburg. (Photo by Karol Serewis/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) will recall about 135k Model S and Model Y luxury vehicles due to some touch-screen related issues, making it one of the electric vehicle bellwether’s largest recalls to date. However, despite the news Tesla stock actually jumped by about 4% in Tuesday’s trading. That doesn’t make any sense - how does that work? Any other car company’s stock would be skewered. Tesla’s most important metric is the time horizon its CEO Elon Musk is able to focus Tesla investors on. This isn’t talked about much and is mostly hidden, but this is the most important driver of Tesla’s stock. Tesla investors have looked through temporary bad news. For example, Tesla’s stock almost doubled between late March and early May 2020 as investors did not care much about the fact that Tesla’s main factory in California remained shut down for more than a month as Covid-19 began to spread. Now, Tesla investors possibly view the current recall which is likely to cost a few hundred million dollars as a drop in the bucket compared to Tesla’s long-term potential. The bottom line is, Tesla and its investors are NOT focused on 2021 or 2022. Mr. Musk, the master entrepreneur, has been able to focus the world much further out. So what’s giving investors the conviction to look this far out? (related:Tesla’s Secret Metric) Firstly, the market for cars is huge. More than 90 million cars are sold annually, with each of Toyota, GM, and Volkswagen selling close to 10 million vehicles every year. Now the auto market is electrifying at a quicker than expected pace, with governments and companies setting aggressive deadlines to move to zero-emission vehicles. For example, the U.K will ban the sale of new gasoline and diesel cars by 2030 and General Motors plans to sell only EVs by 2035. Tesla, a leader in EV technology, has a big early mover advantage as the market electrifies, with the company projecting that it can grow deliveries at a CAGR of about 50% over a multi-year horizon - meaning that it could possibly be selling almost 40x the number of vehicles it currently does by 2030 if it sustains such a growth rate. Although a lot of things need to fall into place for Tesla to grow to these numbers, the company has shown that it is capable of quickly expanding manufacturing capacity, with its Shanghai plant going online in record time, and its factories in Texas and Berlin commencing production sometime this year. (related:Tesla Upside: How Tesla Gets To A $10 Trillion Market Cap) Tesla also has some big advantages in terms of technology. Tesla has a big lead in the self-driving market. Tesla vehicles had driven a cumulative 3 billion autonomous miles as of April 2020, compared to rival Google’s
GOOG
 Waymo which has driven just about 20 million miles. Driving more miles and having more autonomous cars on the road helps Tesla gather data and improve algorithms further. (related: Just How Far Ahead Is Tesla In The Self-Driving Race?) Tesla is also clearly getting more confident about its self-driving software capabilities - it increased pricing for its full self-driving software upgrade from $7,000 to $8,000 in July 2020 and again bumped it up to $10,000 in October. Tesla intends to offer self-driving software subscriptions for 2021, a revenue model much sought after by technology investors, given the stable, recurring cash flows that it brings in. Tesla also has an edge in battery tech. Batteries are a big cost driver of electric vehicles (about 15% of the average price of a Tesla vehicle, per our estimates), and Tesla apparently has among the lowest battery costs per unit in the industry. (related: How Tesla’s Battery Costs Impact Its Gross Margins) Tesla is looking to up its battery game further, targeting a cost reduction of 56% per kilowatt-hour in around three years, by enhancing the way batteries are designed, manufactured, and integrated into its vehicles. The company also outlined plans to produce its own batteries and even mine its own lithium. Tesla’s financials are also shaping up well. Tesla has reported six straight quarters of profitability and its gross margins are structurally higher than peers. For perspective, in 2020 Automotive Gross Margins stood at 25.6%, well ahead of the industry average margins of just 9%. [1] As Tesla’s Revenue base expands and the software component of its sales grow, it could wind up being among the most profitable carmakers. Unlike the struggling Tesla of 2019, liquidity is now hardly an issue. Tesla’s total cash balance stood at about $19 billion as of the end of last year. Additionally, with investors pushing Tesla’s market cap up by over 5x to more than $800 billion over the last 12 months, Tesla can easily tap into the market to fund its growth and innovation with low-cost capital, without really diluting existing shareholders. This is likely a huge competitive advantage for the company and helps to mitigate risk. To summarize, it’s possible that the large market opportunity, Tesla’s technology progress, improving financial performance, and strong liquidity position are giving investors the conviction to look through temporary setbacks and focus on the big picture. That being said, if Tesla shows signs that it is falling behind on its execution in any of the above areas, the stock could see a sharp correction. Trefis Tesla stock has outperformed significantly, but what if you’re looking for a more balanced portfolio instead? Here’s a high-quality portfolio to beat the market, with over 100% return since 2016, versus 55% for the S&P 500. Comprised of companies with strong revenue growth, healthy profits, lots of cash, and low risk, it has outperformed the broader market year after year, consistently.

Our #1 AI Stock Pick is on a steep discount - 29$ instead of 99$! Click here to access exclusive research! Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), founded in 1994, initially started operating as an online book selling company. Over the years, it expanded and added almost every product one can think of to its online marketplace. Today, it is among the top tech giants of the world, holding a major share in the global e-commerce market. The Seattle, Washington-based company just had an amazing quarter. The company on Tuesday reported strong financial results for the fourth quarter, helped by record online sales driven by the pandemic. Amazon reported earnings of $7.2 billion, or $14.09 per share for the three months ended Dec. 30, representing a surge of more than two-folds from $3.3 billion, or $6.47 per share in the comparable period of 2019. Analysts on average were expecting the company to report a profit of $7.34 per share. Revenue jumped 44 percent on a year-over-year basis to $125.6 billion, easily beating the consensus forecast of $119.7 billion. This was the first time that Amazon’s total sales crossed $100 billion in a quarter, thanks to the tremendous demand driven by the pandemic. Amazon shares marginally moved down on Wednesday morning despite reporting impressive quarterly results. The latest drop apparently follows CEO Jeff Bezos’ decision to step down from his position. Following is the brief sales performance summary of the company’s key segments. Amazon Web Services (AWS) Revenue at AWS, which also includes cloud-computing business, rose 28 percent on a year-over-year basis to $12.7 billion, accounting for about 10 percent of the total revenue. The quarterly sales growth at AWS was the slowest in nearly 5 years and missed the consensus forecast of $12.83 billion. Nevertheless, AWS is still leading the global cloud services market and is well ahead of rivals. Other Category Amazon’s “other” segment, which mostly depends on its advertising business, generated revenue of $7.9 billion in the quarter, translating to a surge of 64 percent on a year-over-year basis. Physical Store Segment Revenue from Amazon’s physical store business, led by Whole Foods Market, fell 8 percent on a year-over-year basis, mainly due to the Covid-19 crisis that sent foot traffic down. Most people preferred online shopping options over physically going to stores for buying grocery.

892,"Tesla Inc's TSLA Gigafactory Berlin construction is moving quickly. Earlier this week, CEO Elon Musk shared video of a factory taking shape, with most outer walls in place. Gigafactory Berlin is expected to first produce the Tesla Model Y, with other vehicles coming online later. The Berlin factory will be the first to use Tesla's new 4680 battery cells.  Gigafactory Berlin has 8 Gigapresses that will be used to make the Model Y and possibly other vehicles, according to Teslarati. The current consensus puts Gigafactory Berlin's annual vehicle production rate at around 500,000, but Teslarati said that may be an underestimate because of the capabilities of the Gigapress. The Gigapress is a house-sized machine that can output around 1,000 vehicle castings per day. Even accounting for down time, the presses could be capable of well over 500,000 vehicles per year. Some estimates on Twitter put the production capacity as high as 1.3 million vehicles per year. Other estimates covered by Teslarati predict that Tesla may eventually reach 2 million vehicles per year from this single factory. Benzinga's Take: While vehicle production is one thing, battery production is another. Tesla has historically been battery constrained, not having enough cells to power all the vehicles it wants to produce, along with other products such as the Powerwall. With the Cybertruck and Plaid+ Model S coming online later this year, Tesla will need even more cells. Luckily, the company is working hard to produce its 4680 cells, which will have many benefits. Tesla also continues to buy cells from suppliers such as LG Chem, Panasonic and CATL.  Click here to check out Benzinga’s EV Hub for the latest electric vehicles news.

896,"Investors who have owned stocks since 2016 generally have experienced some big gains. In fact, the SPDR S&P 500 SPY total return in the past five years is 119.9%. But there is no question some big-name stocks performed better than others along the way. Qualcomm’s Big Run: One company that has been a spectacular investment in the past five years is chipmaker QUALCOMM, Inc. QCOM. Qualcomm investors who bought back in 2016 and held on through some extremely volatile times have seen a sizable payoff for their patience. The rise of smartphones, online gaming, cloud computing, cryptocurrency and other innovations created a boom in semiconductor demand over the past decade. See also: Best Telecommunications Stocks Right Now Unfortunately for Qualcomm, the past several years were partially defined by licensing disputes, merger uncertainty and rising competition. In March 2018, U.S. President Donald Trump blocked a potential $117-billion Qualcomm buyout by Broadcom Inc AVGO on national security grounds. After the failed merger, Qualcomm investors got some good news in March 2019 when Qualcomm and Apple, Inc. AAPL reached a settlement on all ongoing lawsuits and agreed to a six-year global patent licensing agreement to preserve their crucial relationship. At the beginning of 2016, Qualcomm shares were trading at around $50. Shares initially dropped as low as $42.24 in early 2016 during a broad market sell-off tied to concerns over a slowdown in China’s economy. Qualcomm rebounded to as high as $71.62 by late 2016, but it wouldn’t make it to the $80 level until the Apple settlement was reached in early 2019.

Yet Qualcomm jumped above $100 to new all-time highs in the second half of 2020 after the company reported big earnings beats driven by strong demand from the global rollout of 5G wireless networks. Qualcomm In 2021, Beyond: Qualcomm shares ultimately topped out at $167.94 in early 2021 before pulling back to around $151 on Thursday morning when the company reported disappointing fiscal first-quarter sales numbers. Despite Thursday’s pullback, Qualcomm investors who bought five years ago and held on still have big profits to show for it. In fact, $1,000 in Qualcomm stock bought in 2016 would be worth about $4,313 today, assuming reinvested dividends. Looking ahead, analysts are expecting Qualcomm shares to continue to push higher in the next 12 months. The average price target among the 27 analysts covering the stock is $175, suggesting 7.8% upside from current levels. © 2024 Benzinga.com. Benzinga does not provide investment advice.

903,"GOTHENBURG, SWEDEN - 2019/09/14: An American automotive and energy company that specialises in ... [+] electric car manufacturing Tesla logo seen in Gothenburg. (Photo by Karol Serewis/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) At current valuations, Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) can raise additional equity capital cheaply, without really diluting shareholders. Sure Tesla
TSLA
 has already raised about $12 billion via three stock issues over the last year and generated close to $3 billion in free cash flows from its operations over 2020 (total cash holding stood at about $19 billion last quarter), but we think it could still use more cash considering that its growth runway is large and its innovation potential huge. Tesla’s deliveries stood at 500k in 2020, and it expects to grow deliveries at a whopping 50% compounded annual rate going forward - meaning that it could be delivering close to 7x as many vehicles by 2025. Tesla stock has seen a stellar run. The stock gained about 8x in 2020 alone and has risen by another 20% year-to-date in 2021, driven by multiple factors including surging deliveries despite Covid-19 and the stock’s inclusion into the S&P 500 index. Tesla’s market cap now stands at over $800 billion - more than the next five largest automakers by market cap, combined. Although stock market valuations mean little to the core operations of mega-cap companies, we believe that they are far more consequential in Tesla’s case. Investors are also counting on Tesla to make fully self-driving cars, launch a fleet of robo taxis, make big improvements to battery tech, and more broadly drive the decarbonization of the auto industry. (related: Just How Far Ahead Is Tesla In The Self-Driving Race?) Tesla has the creative capability and we think it should raise more capital to help it innovate, test, and accelerate. Now, valuations are a complex mix of technical and macro factors, investor sentiment, and company fundamentals and things can change pretty quickly. For example, if the Federal Reserve gives an indication of interest rate hikes, this could make investors rethink exposure to growth stocks, potentially hurting Tesla’s valuation. The EV market is also going to get more crowded with mainstream players like General Motors
GM
 committing to go all-electric in a little over a decade. If these companies are able to deliver compelling EVs, it could diminish the Tesla narrative, hurting its stock. Considering these risks, it would be opportune for Tesla to scale up its fundraising when the stock has momentum on its side. For perspective, if Tesla were to issue about $30 billion worth of stock over the next few quarters, it would increase its total share count by less than 4% at current stock price levels. Although companies typically see stock prices decline with a secondary offering, Tesla stock could actually rise post such a stock issue, as the cash infusion helps to mitigate risk and gives the company a better chance of justifying its lofty valuation in the long-run. Trefis Tesla stock has outperformed significantly, but what if you’re looking for a more balanced portfolio instead? Here’s a high-quality portfolio to beat the market, with over 100% return since 2016, versus 55% for the S&P 500. Comprised of companies with strong revenue growth, healthy profits, lots of cash, and low risk, it has outperformed the broader market year after year, consistently.

(Photo by Toby Scott/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Microsoft’s stock (NASDAQ: MSFT) has risen 3.1% over the last 5 trading days, as major technology and software companies reported earnings in the past week. For Q2 FY 2021 (ended December 2020) Microsoft beat consensus for revenues at $43.08 billion and earnings at $2.05. The market reacted positively to the technology and software company’s results. The above factors have been responsible for a 3.1% rise in Microsoft’s stock in a week. In comparison, the broader S&P 500 fell by 0.5% over the last 5 trading days. Now, is Microsoft’s stock poised to grow? We believe that there is a 62% chance of a rise in Microsoft’s stock over the next month (21 trading days) based on our machine learning analysis of trends in the stock price over the last 5 years. See our analysis on Microsoft Stock Chances Of Rise for more details. 5D: MSFT 3.1%, vs. S&P500 -0.5%; Outperformed market (18% likelihood event)    10D: MSFT 11%, vs. S&P500 0.8%; Outperformed market (12% likelihood event)   21D: MSFT 7.7%, vs. S&P500 2%; Outperformed market (7% likelihood event)   While Microsoft’s stock may continue to grow, 2020 has created many pricing discontinuities which can offer attractive trading opportunities.

906,"Lucid Motors CEO Peter Rawlinson appeared on CNBC Friday morning with Jim Cramer and David Faber, sharing his thoughts on his company, plans for growth the electric vehicle market and rumors of a SPAC deal. About Lucid Motors: One of the hottest SPACs over the last few months has been Churchill Capital Corp IV CCIV, a company linked to rumors of a merger with Lucid Motors. Lucid Motors is focused on the luxury segment of the electric vehicle market, with plans to offer more affordable vehicles in the future that it can mass produce. Lucid Motors Growth: The company is starting small, with plans to sell 6,000 to 7,000 vehicles this year. The Lucid Air Dream car is the first vehicle that will be produced and comes with a starting price of $161,000. Lucid Motors will “increase our volume accordingly” to create a more affordable luxury electric vehicle, Rawlinson said. The Lucid Air will have a starting point of $70,000 in the future, he said. “We’ve already built the first phase of our factory in Arizona,” the CEO said. A six-year plan calls for phase four to be complete in the mid-2020s. The factory will be able to produce 400,000 units a year under phase four. Rawlinson said Lucid Motors is seeing “overwhelming” demand right now, with its “order book growing daily.” Related Link: Churchill Capital Corp IV SPAC Pops On Lucid Motors Rumor The Electric Vehicle Market: Lucid Motors believes it is important to keep its manufacturing in house and control its retail operations. Lots of startups in the electric vehicle space do not have in-house technology, according to Rawlinson. Rawlinson is a former engineer at Tesla Inc TSLA who helped work on the Tesla Model S. “Tesla has done an amazing job,” he said. The CEO referred to a technology race among electric vehicle companies. Technology is why Tesla has a high market cap, Rawlinson said.  Rawlinson said he's disappointed with traditional automakers that haven’t competed with Tesla. The CEO would not call Tesla a competitor, saying its luxury vehicle will compete with Mercedes-Benz. Lucid's Plans To Go Public: CNBC host Faber asked Rawlinson for comment on the SPAC merger speculation. “You know I can’t comment on such matters,” Rawlinson said. The CEO would not confirm or deny that talks had or are being held with Churchill Capital Corp IV. Rawlinson said the value of the company will be realized when the Lucid Motors vehicles are made and are sold to the public. The CEO was asked if demand for Churchill Capital Corp IV had changed his view on the valuation of the company. “I really can’t comment on that right now as you know,” Rawlinson said.  CCIV Price Action: Shares of Churchill Capital Corp IV were trading 7.05% higher to $32.35 at last check Friday.  Disclosure: Author is long shares of CCIV.

908,"Tesla Inc TSLA CEO Elon Musk has said Tesla wants to simplify manufacturing and increase output. One way it's doing so is by constructing its cars in the same way toy cars are made. This has allowed Tesla to produce a two-piece rear and front body casting as opposed to the 70-plus pieces that were previously needed before casting. Tesla shared an impressive video on its Twitter account showing the casting at work.

World’s biggest die casting machine pic.twitter.com/MegnFPKQfh During Tesla's battery and investor day, Musk said Tesla's future advantage will be in manufacturing. The auto world is moving fully electric, and while the company makes good electric vehicles, all companies will eventually have a compelling offering, in his view. By moving over to this die-cast production technique, Tesla hopes to significantly reduce costs and production time, while also improving safety and output.  Click here to check out Benzinga’s EV Hub for the latest electric vehicles news.

915,"February started strong in the markets. Though the past week remained somewhat volatile, the three big U.S. indexes managed to post handy gains, led by the 6% or so rise in the Nasdaq. Hope for additional stimulus and a little improvement in the unemployment rate no doubt helped. Perhaps the week's biggest surprise, dropped among the remaining FAANG earnings reports, was news of a big tech management change that involved one of the world's richest persons. The GameStop kerfuffle moved on to its next chapter last week too, and another COVID-19 vaccine moved forward. Also, the electric vehicle leader was forced to recall cars. Finally, the new administration faced a fresh foreign policy challenge last week. And things were looking up for federal cannabis legalization. Through it all, Benzinga continued to examine the prospects for many of the stocks most popular with investors. Here are a few of this past week's most bullish and bearish posts that are worth another look. J.J. Kinahan's ""Online Retail Sales Provide Strong Tailwinds For Amazon"" discusses how Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN may be under pressure to show continuous innovation for its retail business and beyond when the pandemic wanes, but it appears to be up to the challenge, at least in the foreseeable future. ""Tesla Gets A Street High $1,200 Price Target: 'The Fireworks Aren't Over Yet'"" by Shanthi Rexaline examines why a key analyst is dissuading investors from selling Tesla Inc TSLA stock. Will any downside catalyst that materializes be met with eager buying? In ""Ark Funds Bet On Growth Of Sports Betting With DraftKings Addition,"" Chris Katje is focused on why a renowned fund manager is betting on DraftKings Inc DKNG. Could the fund take a larger position in this market leader? Will it add additional companies with exposure to the sports betting market? Priya Nigam's ""Why This Comcast Analyst Is Turning Bullish: 'Best-In-Class Cable Business'"" shows that Comcast Corporation CMCSA seems to be moving in the right direction and its stock should outperform over the next 12 months. General Electric Company GE has posted better-than-expected fourth-quarter industrial free cash flow. So says Wayne Duggan's ""Analyst Raises General Electric Target Following FCF Deep Dive."" But is the company being overly cautious with its guidance? For additional bullish calls of the past week, also have a look at the following: In Shanthi Rexaline's ""Moderna Analyst: Unrealistic COVID-19 Vaccine Expectations Create Unfavorable Setup,"" find out how an extended Moderna Inc MRNA rally has made the stock increasingly difficult to justify on a fundamental basis. The valuation of Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. BBBY was too rich for one top analyst, according to ""KeyBanc Downgrades Bed Bath & Beyond On Valuation, Competition"" by Priya Nigam. This downgrade came even though the analyst thinks highly of the retailer's turnaround plan. In Jayson Derrick's ""3 eBay Analysts On Q4 Beat, Valuation, 'Compelling Growth' In Shoes, Watches,"" see why some analysts remain cautious on eBay Inc EBAY stock even though the company reported better than expected quarterly results. ""JPMorgan Says Gogo's Stock 'More Than Fully Valued' After Flying Higher By 39%"" by Jayson Derrick makes the case that Gogo Inc DASH stock is ""more than fully valued"" according to a top analyst.

For context, this figure exceeds the combined market caps of Nvidia ($336 billion), AMD ($106 billion) and Micron ($90 billion) three times over. See Also: How To Buy Microsoft Stock. Our survey found 32% percent of respondents saying Microsoft should move forward on an M&A with AMD in 2021. AMD designs and produces microprocessors for the computer and consumer electronics industries. The majority of the firm's sales are in CPUs and graphics processing units. Many traders and investors were vocal in their support of AMD, saying it has time and again proven itself with its processors and GPUs in the gaming industry. Respondents said AMD should be seriously considered as a top M&A contender with Microsoft, as the two tech companies have had several prior partnerships, including a recent Xbox Series X|S project which integrates full AMD RDNA 2 architecture. Next, 28% of traders and investors responded that Microsoft should complete an M&A with Nvidia this year. Nvidia is a leading designer of GPUs. The company’s chips are used in a variety of markets, including high-end PCs for gaming, in a GPU-accelerated AI shopping tool for Facebook, Inc. FB and for autonomous driving tech in many Tesla Inc TSLA electric vehicles. Respondents in this group cited Nvidia as an essential developer and leader in future chipmaking that has made a name for itself in the auto and bio-intelligence industries. An Nvidia acquisition would immediately bolster Microsoft’s mobile computing units. Only 6% of traders and investors saw a Microsoft-Micron M&A making sense during 2021. Respondents said Microsoft should look to acquire Micron’s ultra-bandwidth solutions, which are known to deliver maximum bandwidth to feed client’s data-hungry workloads like high-performance computing, artificial intelligence systems and professional visualization workstations, as traders believe these fields will continue to spike in demand amid a transition to long-term remote working conditions.  Finally, 30% said Microsoft should not acquire any of the three companies.  It’s worth noting that several respondents who were opposed to these M&As believed the Redmond-based tech giant would be better served focusing on research, development of cloud-based tech and a possible M&A in the cloud sector. This survey was conducted by Benzinga in February 2021 and included the responses of a diverse population of adults 18 or older. Opting into the survey was completely voluntary, with no incentives offered to potential respondents. The study reflects results from over 1000 adults.

Respondents said Microsoft should look to acquire Micron’s ultra-bandwidth solutions, which are known to deliver maximum bandwidth to feed client’s data-hungry workloads like high-performance computing, artificial intelligence systems and professional visualization workstations, as traders believe these fields will continue to spike in demand amid a transition to long-term remote working conditions.  Finally, 30% said Microsoft should not acquire any of the three companies.  It’s worth noting that several respondents who were opposed to these M&As believed the Redmond-based tech giant would be better served focusing on research, development of cloud-based tech and a possible M&A in the cloud sector. This survey was conducted by Benzinga in February 2021 and included the responses of a diverse population of adults 18 or older. Opting into the survey was completely voluntary, with no incentives offered to potential respondents. The study reflects results from over 1000 adults.

919,"Apple Inc’s AAPL rumored discussions with Hyundai Motor Co. and its subsidiary Kia Motors Corp. about building an electric vehicle have been put on hold, Bloomberg has reported. What Happened: Apple was upset about Hyundai's announcement in January that it was in talks to join the electric car project. However, later on, Hyundai and its subsidiary Kia backed away from the statement. It's not clear when the discussions might resume. See also: How To Buy Apple Stock A South Korean newspaper reported this week that Kia had received a $3.6 billion investment from Apple as part of a collaboration to make electric vehicles. According to the report, the deal was supposed to be signed on February 17 and the manufacture of the electric car was slated for 2024.  Why It Matters: Speculation has been rampant over the deal as there reportedly are internal differences within Hyundai over it. Bloomberg reported that there is a dispute about whether Hyundai or Kia will get to produce the Apple autonomous vehicle. Earlier, Apple Insider reported, quoting TF Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, that Apple has been discussing similar plans with other automakers like General Motors Company GM and Stellantis NV STLA. Kuo said Apple’s first EV will likely be built on Hyundai’s E-GMP platform, which is made up of two motors and has a maximum range of 310 miles on a full charge.

922,"Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has ordered more than 700 delivery trucks that run on compressed natural gas, as it tries to reduce its carbon footprint, Reuters has reported. What Happened: A joint venture between Cummins Inc. (NYSE:CMI) and Westport Fuel Systems Inc (NASDAQ:WPRT) will supply the engines. Amazon told Reuters that it has ordered more than 700 trucks so far. An unnamed source also told Reuters that the Cummins-Westport JV has ordered more than 1,000 engines in total. The trucks will be used for deliveries between warehouses and distribution centers. Why It Matters: Amazon aims to have net-zero carbon emissions across the whole company by 2040. And it aims to have 50% of all shipments be net zero by 2030.
		  The pandemic caused an uptick in heavy duty truck traffic, as more people and businesses relied on e-commerce and deliveries, Reuters noted. Natural gas burns about 27% cleaner than the diesel fuel used in big trucks. Indices Commodities Currencies Stocks"

926,"This article was originally published on February 7, 2021 7:04 am It was one of the most read articles on Benzinga.com this year. Every week, Benzinga conducts a survey to collect sentiment on what traders are most excited about, interested in or thinking about as they manage and build their personal portfolios. This week we posed the following question to over 1,000 traders and investors regarding Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, Netflix Inc NFLX and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc AMC: Over the next year, should Amazon or Netflix try to buy AMC? Amazon should buy AMC Netflix should buy AMC Neither should buy AMC For starters — why might Amazon or Netflix look to purchase the ultra-depressed theater chain? See also: How to Buy Amazon Stock Our team reported in June 2020 how BofA Securities analyst Nat Schindler said a theater buyout made sense — and Amazon may not be the only tech company interested. Schindler said Amazon and Netflix may be looking to take advantage of depressed theater valuations to follow the omnichannel blueprint of Amazon’s buyout of grocery store chain Whole Foods. For market-share context — AMC is not only America’s largest theater chain by locations in the US but the largest in the world.
Following the recent, unheralded wave of retail investor interest in AMC amid the Reddit rally — and subsequent fall back to earth — it’s high time to ask the question once again: Does it make sense for Amazon or Netflix to make the move into the physical theater space? For starters, with AMC shares trading around $7 for a corresponding market cap of $2.32 billion, along with an enterprise value of $11.35 billion, this valuation is a pittance for either of the FAANG tech giants.  It can be said the financial risk to either Amazon or Netflix of an AMC M&A would be minimal at worst, with market caps of $1.69 trillion and $244 billion, respectively.  This week’s study found 44% of respondents saying a Netflix-AMC M&A would make sense in 2021.  In what particular ways could Netflix leverage AMC? One respondent noted “in the midst of this pandemic, there’s no doubt we live in a world where it seems people want to have everything streamed in their homes, including the new film movies that come out in theaters. One idea is Netflix could operate AMC, and a number of their new releases would go to the theaters first, then a month or two later be on Netflix. “Viewers who missed going to the movies, but are loyal fans of Netflix original films, will get the best of both worlds in the event of a Netflix-AMC M&A."" Many respondents also believe that people will still indeed want to go to the movies post-pandemic, families and couples most notably, and the ability to see Netflix-exclusive movies on the big screen could be a serious draw for feature film buffs with pent-up demand. Next, 24% of respondents said Amazon should complete an M&A deal with AMC this year. Many traders and investors who participated in our study said Amazon could make admission to theaters available as a Prime Video option. Amazon chief Jeff Bezos announced in Thursday’s fourth-quarter earnings report that Amazon Prime membership has exceeded 150 million. See Also: How To Buy Amazon Stock. Finally, 32% percent of traders and investors told us Amazon and Netflix should both avoid acquiring AMC in 2021. Many respondents were adamant the theater business wasn’t working financially before the pandemic, isn’t working now and won’t work anytime in the near term. Another argument from traders and investors was it’s likely cheaper, and just makes more sense from a marketing perspective, for Netflix and Amazon to start a new theater company altogether than bothering to rescue AMC and their outstanding debt through an M&A deal. This survey was conducted by Benzinga in February 2021 and included the responses of a diverse population of adults 18 or older. Opting into the survey was completely voluntary, with no incentives offered to potential respondents. The study reflects results from over 1,000 adults.

931,"Cathie Wood is a big name in the investment world due to the tremendous success of ARK Investment Management. Wood is the founder and CEO of Ark, and her company's portfolios have been bringing in returns of more than 100%. In 2020, Ark had inflows of $30 billion and in January 2021, a return of $8 billion. What Happened: On Tuesday, Wood, appeared on Yahoo Finance to highlight the electric vehicle and Bitcoin (BTC) portions of Ark's “Big Ideas 2021” presentation, released on Jan. 26. Wood said that Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) will continue to be the leader in EVs in the U.S. and China, but also said she thinks “China might hold the secret to the next big winners.” The Chinese EV makers Wood pointed to are Nio Inc-ADR (NYSE:NIO), Xpeng Inc. (NYSE:XPEV) and BYD Company Limited (OTC:BYDDF). But if she “had to give you which of the Chinese names we have the highest conviction in, it’s probably Baidu,” because the “government has deemed it the autonomous platform for China.” Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU) recently announced plans to create an EV company.  Related Link: 15 Big Ideas In 'Disruptive Innovation' According To Cathie Wood, Ark Funds Wood also talked about the institutional behavior around Bitcoin and how large companies are starting to put their cash reserves into it. Wood does not believe $40,000 is the top in Bitcoin and pointed that with its approximate $600 billion market cap it is only half the size of Apple Inc. (NASDQ: AAPL) or Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) but has a ""much bigger idea than either of those two because it is the first global digital currency out there.”
		  Wood pointed to Square Inc. (NYSE:SQ) placing 1% of its assets into Bitcoin, and Microstrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) putting all of its available cash into Bitcoin, but said the most surprising institution buying the cryptocurrency has been MassMutual. Wood said MassMutual is “very conservative and very regulated” and would have had to “jump through many more regulatory hurdles” to buy the $100 million of Bitcoin it has put into its account. Wood says this is “a seal of approval.” What’s Next: Investors are always speculating about which companies will become the next ""big idea"" for Ark and are watching closely as ARK updates its portfolios.

943,"Tesla Inc. TSLA CEO Elon Musk is on a tweet-spree promoting Dogecoin (DOGE) and scammers are seeing an opportunity to make some quick bucks. What Happened: A sophisticated giveaway scam in the name of Elon Musk was spotted across social media platforms, including those of Twitter Inc. TWTR and Reddit, on Sunday. A screenshot, likely manipulated through a graphics editor like Photoshop, that shows the verified Elon Musk twitter account saying ""to celebrate crypto, our marketing department has decided to have a give away"" was circulating on Reddit, as spotted by u/nicoznico.

Microsoft now represents the largest position in the Portfolio. Early in the pandemic, CEO Satya Nadella said, “We’ve just seen two years’ worth of digital transformation in two months,” and many of the company’s business segments continue to benefit. Notably, Microsoft 365 (Teams, Azure, Windows virtual desktop and security), Windows, Surface, and gaming are all experiencing increased demand.

957,"Tesla Inc. TSLA disclosed Monday it has invested $1.5 billion in Bitcoin cryptocurrency. It plans to begin accepting it in payment for its electric vehicles. The move was included in the business risks section of Tesla's annual 10-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been tweeting cryptic but supportive messages to feed the craze over the meme-based Dogecoin cryptocurrency.  In its SEC filing, Tesla wrote that it updated its investment policy in January ""to provide us with more flexibility to further diversify and maximize returns on our cash that is not required to maintain adequate operating liquidity."" That could be read as speculating. Regulators could take notice. Musk ran afoul of the SEC in 2018 when he tweeted that he could take Tesla private at $420 per share. In a settlement with the government, Musk agreed to step down as chairman of the company. He and Tesla each were fined $20 million. Tesla shares have more than quadrupled. They closed Friday at $852.23, almost double the $446 share price following a 5-for-1 stock split on Aug. 31. Tesla's valuation exceeds $773 billion. That is more than the combined value of the world's major automakers. Musk is the world's richest man. His net worth of around $200 billion. The new investment policy, approved by Tesla's audit committee, covers ""certain alternative reserve assets, including digital assets, gold bullion, gold exchange-traded funds and other assets as specified in the future."" That included the $1.5 billion investment in Bitcoin.  Tesla ""may acquire and hold digital assets from time to time or long term."" And the automaker expects to soon accept Bitcoin in payment its electric vehicles. That would be ""subject to applicable laws and initially on a limited basis, which we may or may not liquidate upon receipt."" Tesla listed unpredictable things that could go wrong: price volatility, faddishness, long-term adoption, lack of a physical form, reliance on technology to buy and sell, cyberattacks and accounting issues. ""Finally, the extent to which securities laws or other regulations apply or may apply in the future to such assets is unclear and may change in the future,"" the filing said.

965,"Bitcoin (BTC) has surpassed the $46,000 mark minutes after it broke $45,000. What Happened: The leading cryptocurrency has had a record-breaking day, surpassing the $44,000 levels earlier today, rising to $45,000 and then to $46,000 in a matter of minutes, according to a data platform CoinMarketCap (CMC). The current BTC price spike follows the news about Tesla Inc TSLA buying $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin, according to its SEC filing. What Else: CoinMarketCap has announced today it had “experienced an all-time high in traffic.” “On CMC, almost all of the top ten ranked cryptocurrencies are up as well (with the exception of XRP), which shows that sometimes, altcoin prices tend to correlate (at least temporarily) with large Bitcoin movements in either direction,” a CMC spokesperson has said to Benzinga. The surprising part is that the majority of users were not interested in Bitcoin. “During the Bitcoin price increase today, we actually saw higher traffic on DOGE's coin page than on Bitcoin's.” © 2024 Benzinga.com.

968,"Tesla Inc’s TSLA $1.5 billion investment led Bitcoin (BTC) to shoot past the $47,000 mark at one point on Monday evening but the euphoria is even more pronounced in some altcoins.  What Happened: BTC was up 20.98% at $46,485.07 in a 24-hour window as of press time, according to CoinMarketCap data. Grayscale Bitcoin Trust GBTC ended Monday 20.62% higher at $45.69. The apex cryptocurrency’s gains were bested by several smaller altcoins, which rallied smartly in the same period. Telcoin (TEL), an Ethereum (ETH)-based cryptocurrency aimed at telecom operators, traded 52.42% higher at $0.004. Pundi X (NPXS) — a token aimed at facilitating payments — soared 74.27% at $0.00086.

Total cryptocurrency market cap hovered at $1.35 trillion, with BTC domination of 63.4% at press time.   © 2024 Benzinga.com. Benzinga does not provide investment advice. All rights reserved.

970,"Sony Corp.’s SNE next-gen gaming console, the PlayStation5, is launching in China in the second quarter of this year, subsidiary Sony Interactive Entertainment’s officials confirmed Monday. What Happened: The news was first shared by Niko Partners analyst Daniel Ahmad on Twitter. Sony China has confirmed that it plans to officially launch the PlayStation 5 in Mainland China during Q2 2021.
Tatsuo Eguchi, the president of SIE Shanghai and Soeda Takehito, the vice chairman, confirmed the new today in a special Chinese New Year greetings video. pic.twitter.com/nhFzbZQTGx Ahmad noted that the approval for the PS5 hardware from Chinese authorities had come back in December. According to the analyst, the PS5 to be launched will be the “official Mainland China version,” and will likely carry an online services region lock.  Why It Matters: China scrapped a 15-year old ban on the sale of gaming consoles in the country in 2015, as reported by the Wall Street Journal at the time. Sony’s PS4 consoles launched in China in March 2015, after seeing an initial international launch in 2013. PS5 launched internationally in November last year, but China wasn’t on the list of countries. China heavily regulates the gaming industry. Sony temporarily suspended the PlayStation Store in mainland China in May 2020, without giving a timeline, Reuters reported.  The company said at the time the suspension was over ""system security upgrade"" but it came amid reports of users in the country being able to circumvent China's restrictions on downloading unlicensed games by switching to overseas services. Microsoft Corp. MSFT is yet to make an announcement regarding the launch of its next-gen consoles in the country. Sony reported selling 4.5 million PS5 units in 2020. There has been overwhelming demand for the consoles and the company has struggled to keep up the supply. Price Action: Sony shares closed 0.87% lower at $115.62 on Monday. © 2024 Benzinga.com.

971,"Former hedge fund manager Michael Novogratz said Monday that Bitcoin (BTC) could more than double to $100,000 by the end of 2021 as more people are allowed to make purchases using the cryptocurrency, Bloomberg reported. What Happened: “You’re going to see every company in America do the same thing,” said the founder of Galaxy Digital Holdings Ltd. BRPHF, a cryptocurrency investor company in an interview on Bloomberg Television. “It doesn’t have to be a lot. It’s the messaging that matters, you’re seeing the herd here, and it’s coming.” Novogratz praised Tesla Inc TSLA CEO Elon Musk and called him a “genius” pointing to his decision to “listen to the people.” “One of the things that connect Bitcoin, and Tesla and solar stocks and ESG investing is millennials and Gen Z, young people are buying into the future, and they see cryptocurrencies — Bitcoin and other cryptos — as their currencies,” said Novogratz. Why It Matters: On Monday, Tesla said it had invested an aggregate of $1.5 billion of cash in BTC. The automaker said it would start to accept the apex cryptocurrency as a payment option in the future on a limited basis. MicroStrategy Incorporated MSTR CEO Michael Saylor, an ardent BTC supporter, called the cryptocurrency, the “scarcest asset in the world,” Bloomberg reported separately. MicroStrategy holds 71,079 bitcoins that it purchased at an aggregate purchase price of $1.145 billion at an average purchase price of nearly $16,109 per bitcoin, according to an SEC filing.  See Also: MicroStrategy Just Can't Get Enough Of Bitcoin — To Now Raise $550M In Debt To Fund Purchase On Monday, multiple analysts and commentators expressed their thoughts on Tesla’s Bitcoin purchase in a largely positive manner.

976,"Tesla Inc TSLA China sales doubled on a year-on-year basis to $6.6 billion, the electric vehicle maker said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing. What Happened: The Elon Musk-led company said in its annual report that 21.11% out of its total revenue of $31.54 billion for 2020 came from China. The number is a marked rise from the previous year when China made up for 12.12% of sales worth $2.98 billion out of a total sales revenue of $24.58 billion. The United States — the largest market for the automaker — saw sales rise 20.18% to $15.2 billion from $12.65 billion last year. U.S. sales account for 48.19% of all revenue for the Palo Alto-based EV company. Why It Matters: Sales of Shanghai-made Tesla Model 3 vehicles commenced last year in China.  The company has been expanding its production facilities to mass produce Model Y vehicles for sale in China. At the beginning of 2021, Tesla received enough orders to finish its supply of Model Y vehicles for the first three months of the current year, as per Electrek. However, it is not been totally smooth sailing for the company in China. On Monday, the automaker received a warning from the country’s top regulator, along with four other agencies, regarding consumer complaints. Tesla said last week, it was recalling 36,126 Model S and X vehicles in China due to issues related to faulty touchscreens, according to CNBC. The U.S. automaker faces competition from local Chinese rivals like Xpeng Inc XPEV, Nio Inc NIO, and Berkshire Hathaway Inc (NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) Chairman Warren Buffet-backed BYD Company Limited BYDDF.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy Tesla Inc.’s foray into bitcoin was an “unusual” way to spend its cash, according to some Wall Street investors.  Companies typically hold their corporate cash in safer assets, including short-term fixed income and other Treasury securities in order to ensure liquidity and to limit volatility. “Most shareholders own Tesla because they expect them to make money selling cars, not by trading cryptocurrencies with shareholder capital,” said Jerry Klein, managing director and partner at New York-based Treasury Partners, an advisory with $8 billion in assets. “Companies rely on this cash for many uses including research and development, acquisitions and share buybacks.” A filing released Monday by Tesla said the Palo Alto-based electric-car maker has amassed a $1.5 billion position in bitcoin, worth about 7.8% of its total cash. TESLA BUYS $1.5B IN BITCOIN, WILL START ACCEPTING FOR CARS The company said it might make investments in other alternative reserve assets including digital assets, gold bullion, gold exchange-traded funds or elsewhere. Tesla’s bitcoin holdings are a “relatively small percentage” of its overall cash said Garrett Nelson, an analyst at CFRA Research, noting that companies often make investments in non-core assets. He said that while bitcoin’s volatility is “definitely a concern” as the company is currently in “hyper growth mode” which will require a lot of capital. ELON MUSK BACKS BITCOIN, TALKS FUTURE OF CRYPTO CURRENCY Bitcoin’s price has been known to swing 20% in a single day. That type of volatility will make some investors uneasy, especially at a time when the company will need capital to meet its ambitious growth plans. Tesla is currently building factories in Austin, Texas and Germany and recent reports suggest there are plans for a plant in India. The company aims to grow its annual auto volume by a factor of 40 over the next decade – from about 500,000 vehicles last year to 20 million by 2030. As Tesla’s sales increase so too will operating cash flow, which will help fund the company’s factories. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE STORIES ON FOX BUSINESS Tesla being an $800 billion company gives it a “cost of capital advantage” that will help drive its growth, making its investment in bitcoin less of an issue, Nelson said. The company has seen its stock price increase following all three equity offerings last year. Tesla shares were up 22% this year through Monday compared with the S&P 500’s 4.25% gain.

989,"Netflix, Inc NFLX shares are up 52.6% in the past year, and some massive option trades on Tuesday suggest the stock is on the radar of at least one huge trader. The Netflix Trades: On Tuesday, Benzinga Pro subscribers received several alerts related to unusually large Netflix option trades. Seven of the trades stood out because of their size and timing: Between 12:21 p.m. ET and 12:26 p.m. ET, likely a single trader bought and sold a massive amount of Netflix call options with a $570 strike price expiring on June 18. The contracts were bought and sold near bid and ask prices within a $1.50 range of $48.50. See also: How to Buy Netflix Stock In all, the trader bought 1,426 Netflix call options near the ask price and sold 820 of the same contracts within a five-minute stretch. Another 882 contracts were traded near the middle of the bid-ask spread, trades typically considered neutral. Why It’s Important For Netflix Investors: Even traders who stick exclusively to stocks often monitor option market activity closely for unusually large trades. Given the relative complexity of the options market, large options traders are typically considered to be more sophisticated than the average stock trader. Many of these large options traders are wealthy individuals or institutions who may have unique information or theses related to the underlying stock. Unfortunately, stock traders often use the options market to hedge against their larger stock positions, and there’s no surefire way to determine if an options trade is a standalone position or a hedge. In this case, given the relatively large size and timing of the call purchases on Tuesday, they could certainly be an institutional hedge. More Netflix Upside Ahead? The pandemic has worked wonders for Netflix’s subscriber growth, including another 8.5 million global paid subscribers added in the fourth quarter. Netflix investors were also pleasantly surprised when the company said it could consider implementing a share buyback program in the near future now that it appears to have become consistently cash flow-positive. Investors concerned about Netflix’s ability to fend off a wave of new streaming video competition from Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, Walt Disney Co DIS and others have likely been extremely impressed by the resiliency of Netflix’s growth trajectory over the past several quarters. Netflix is also staring down the parallel of some extremely difficult year-over-year comparisons in 2021, which could spook the market. Benzinga’s Take: Subtracting the calls sold near the bid from the calls purchased near the ask results in a potential net purchase of 606 Netflix call contracts for a price of around $48.50, a potentially $2.9-million bullish bet. It’s difficult to determine whether the trades executed near the bid-ask midpoint added or subtracted from that net long position. Assuming the trader ended up net long on Netflix, the break-even price for the calls in question is about $618.50, suggesting another 10.7% upside over the next four months. © 2024 Benzinga.com.

998,"A Reddit poster who claimed to be in the know of Tesla Inc’s TSLA investment in Bitcoin (BTC) has confirmed that the information he made public on Jan. 2 was not true, the New York Post reported Tuesday. What Happened: After Tesla made its Bitcoin investment announcement on Monday, attention turned to the Reddit post by the user TSLAInsider made five-weeks prior. See also: How to Buy Bitcoin (BTC) “I am a software dev working at R&D at Tesla in California, over the past 72 hours our company bought 24701 BTC at an average price of 33142$,” the user with the handle TSLAinsider posted on Reddit last month,” the post read, as reported by Reuters. The Post claimed that the Reddit user behind the TSLAInsider handle is a 24-year old German political science student named Hendrik. “If you want to know the truth: I am a young German guy and I was on Acid while I did this post in the last month,” Hendrik told the Post in an interview. “I had this afflatus that Elon is going to buy Bitcoin, so I created this trollpost. And now all the newspapers around the globe are writing about it, its kinda funny and scary to be honest.” The user posted a link to the Post’s story and appeared to corroborate it.  Why It Matters: Reddit forums have been in the increased spotlight ever since r/WallStreetBets took Wall Street bigwigs head-on with a short squeeze in the shares of GameStop Corp GME, AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc AMC, Blackberry Ltd BB, and others. See Also: Reddit Pays Ode To GameStop 'Underdogs' In 5-Second Super Bowl Ad Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen last week said last week that financial market regulators needed to take stock of the frenzy surrounding GameStop and other stocks before taking any action, according to Reuters.

999,"Amazon.com, Inc AMZN-backed Rivian Automotive Inc may go public as early as September, Bloomberg reported Tuesday. What Happened: The California-based automaker — also backed by Ford Motor Company F — could achieve a valuation of nearly $50 billion or more, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg. See also: How to Invest in Tesla Stock The IPO timing is not certain and the listing could occur in late 2021 or even 2022, according to Bloomberg’s sources.
